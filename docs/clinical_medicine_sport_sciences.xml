Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    To examine the associations between the number of days per week achieving various daily step thresholds and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in older women.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    We conducted a prospective cohort study of 13 547 women free of CVD and cancer (mean age 71.8 years). We included participants who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 consecutive days between 2011–2015 and were subsequently followed for mortality through 2024. Women were classified by the number of days per week achieving step thresholds of ≥4000, ≥5000, ≥6000 or ≥7000 steps/day. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all-cause mortality and CVD incidence, adjusting for lifestyle behaviours and comorbidities.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    During a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 1765 women (13.0%) died and 781 (5.1%) developed CVD. Achieving ≥4000 steps/day on 1–2 and ≥3 days/week was associated with lower mortality risk compared with 0 days/week (adjusted HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.86) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.68), respectively). For CVD, corresponding results were 0.73 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.92) and 0.73 (95% CI 60 to 0.89), respectively. An inverse curvilinear dose-response relationship was observed for mortality, such that with higher step thresholds (5000, 6000 or 7000), the risk of mortality further declined modestly. With additional adjustment for mean daily steps, associations were attenuated to the null.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Among older women, achieving ≥4000 steps/day on even 1–2 days/week was associated with lower mortality and CVD, while more steps were associated with even better outcomes. A greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes.

Abstract: 
                    
                      Background
                      :
                    
                    The role of high-volume low-intensity training for enhancing endurance performance has gained growing interest in recent years. Specifically, so-called “zone 2 training” is currently receiving much attention, and many propose that this is the target intensity at which a large proportion of total endurance training should be performed. However, despite the popularity of this concept, there is no clear consensus among coaches, athletes, and scientists regarding the definition of zone 2 training.
                    
                      Purpose
                      :
                    
                    This commentary summarizes the perspectives, experience, and knowledge of an expert panel of 14 applied sport scientists and professional coaches with the aim of providing insight and a basis for definitional consensus on zone 2 training. Moreover, potential training strategies at this intensity are proposed, and the expected physiological adaptations when exercising at this intensity and related research gaps are also discussed.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Experts reached consensus that zone 2 training should preferably be performed at intensities located immediately below the first lactate or ventilatory threshold through continuous, variable, or interval-type sessions. Furthermore, experts expected a broad range of central and peripheral adaptations from zone 2 training. These expected adaptations might not be unique to zone 2 and could also be induced with sessions performed at slightly higher and lower intensities.
                    
                      Conclusions
                      :
                    
                    This commentary provides practical insight and unified criteria regarding the preferred intensity, duration, and session type for the optimization of zone 2 training based on the perspectives of acknowledged sport scientists and professional coaches.

Abstract: Abstract
                  Exercise has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy in cancer management. Long-term supervised exercise programs, including resistance training and aerobic training, can improve body composition and physical fitness, modulate circulating factors (e.g., hormones, cytokines), enhance treatment tolerance, and reduce side effects, potentially influencing cancer progression and reducing mortality risk. Despite advancements in exercise oncology, opportunities remain to refine exercise prescription through the integration of advanced methodologies such as periodization and autoregulatory programming strategies. Periodization, a systematic approach to organizing training over time, has demonstrated benefits in general fitness and clinical populations but is underexplored in cancer care. Emerging evidence suggests periodized exercise programs may enhance physical fitness (e.g., muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness) while mitigating treatment-related side effects (e.g., fatigue, loss of bone mineral density). Here, we examine the mechanisms underlying the benefits of periodization in exercise oncology and propose an updated framework for its implementation across the cancer continuum (e.g., neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, survivorship). Incorporating parallel or emphasis periodized models tailored to individual needs may optimize outcomes. These models of periodization and the use of autoregulatory programming strategies allow exercise intensity and volume to be modulated in response to patients’ symptoms and fatigue, ensuring safety and adherence, while aligning with the goals established by the periodized training plan. Ultimately, future research should explore complementary strategies such as nutrition and psychological periodization. By adopting a holistic and individualized approach, clinicians can improve the effectiveness of exercise interventions and ultimately enhance the quality of life for patients with cancer.
