Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    To examine the associations between the number of days per week achieving various daily step thresholds and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in older women.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    We conducted a prospective cohort study of 13 547 women free of CVD and cancer (mean age 71.8 years). We included participants who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 consecutive days between 2011–2015 and were subsequently followed for mortality through 2024. Women were classified by the number of days per week achieving step thresholds of ≥4000, ≥5000, ≥6000 or ≥7000 steps/day. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all-cause mortality and CVD incidence, adjusting for lifestyle behaviours and comorbidities.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    During a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 1765 women (13.0%) died and 781 (5.1%) developed CVD. Achieving ≥4000 steps/day on 1–2 and ≥3 days/week was associated with lower mortality risk compared with 0 days/week (adjusted HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.86) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.68), respectively). For CVD, corresponding results were 0.73 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.92) and 0.73 (95% CI 60 to 0.89), respectively. An inverse curvilinear dose-response relationship was observed for mortality, such that with higher step thresholds (5000, 6000 or 7000), the risk of mortality further declined modestly. With additional adjustment for mean daily steps, associations were attenuated to the null.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Among older women, achieving ≥4000 steps/day on even 1–2 days/week was associated with lower mortality and CVD, while more steps were associated with even better outcomes. A greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes.

Abstract: 
                    
                      Objective
                      :
                    
                    The aim of this paper was to undertake a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-accordant meta-analysis comparing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in older and younger adults.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    Google Scholar, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were searched in June 2023 for the terms “ageing” OR “age” OR “middle-aged” OR “old” OR “older” OR “elderly” OR “masters” OR “veteran” AND “muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle injury” OR “contraction-induced injury” OR “muscle soreness” OR “delayed onset muscle soreness” OR “creatine kinase.” From 1,092 originally identified titles, 36 studies were included which had an exercise component comparing a younger against an older group. The outcome variables of EIMD were muscle function, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase. A meta-analysis was conducted on change to EIMD after exercise in older versus younger adults using standardized mean difference (SMD) and an inverse-variance random effects model.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Change after 24 and 72 hr, and peak change, in muscle function was not different between old and young (SMD range = −0.16 to −0.35). Muscle soreness was greater in younger than older adults for all comparisons (SMD range = −0.34 to −0.62). Creatine kinase was greater in younger than older adults at 24 hr (SMD = −0.32), as was peak change (SMD = −0.32). A relationship between sex and peak muscle function change was evident for males (SMD = −0.45), but not females (SMD = −0.44). All other meta-regression was nonsignificant.
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    Advancing age is not associated with greater symptoms of EIMD. The implication of this study is that the older adults can pursue regular physical activity without concern for experiencing greater EIMD.

                    Physical fitness screening measures for older athletes are lacking in clinical and research arenas. This study aims to define the Sustained Athlete Fitness Exam (SAFE), a comprehensive tool developed using age and sex-based normative data from U.S. National Senior Games athletes, and to investigate any SAFE differences by age, sex, sport, or exercise volume.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    This cross-sectional study engaged 4,659 U.S. National Senior Games athletes (
                    M
                    age
                     = 67.65,
                    SD
                     = 9.12, 59.1% female). Athletes completed health history questions and physical performance measures addressing cardiovascular, muscular, flexibility, and balance subscales. Scoring applied age and sex norms from the study population. Outcomes were compared by age group, sex, sport, and exercise volume.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    All 22 National Senior Games sports were represented in the study population. Health histories revealed low rates of chronic conditions, with 28.5% reporting none. Median weekly cardiovascular and resistance exercise volumes were 240 and 30 min, respectively. Of the 20 points possible on the SAFE, scores ranged from 2 (0.2%) to 20 (0.8%), with a median of 13. SAFE scoring demonstrated minimal differences by age group or sex and aligned predictably by sport. Higher exercise volumes were associated with superior SAFE composite scores, with nearly all subscales following this trend.
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    The SAFE and associated norms offer population-specific comparisons previously unavailable for older athletes, with a tool able to address multiple domains of physical fitness while avoiding ceiling and floor effects.
                    
                      Significance/Implications
                      :
                    
                    These findings provide the opportunity to improve assessment, treatment, preventative medicine, and training support for a growing demographic.
