Abstract: 
                    
                      Objective
                      :
                    
                    The aim of this paper was to undertake a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-accordant meta-analysis comparing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in older and younger adults.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    Google Scholar, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were searched in June 2023 for the terms “ageing” OR “age” OR “middle-aged” OR “old” OR “older” OR “elderly” OR “masters” OR “veteran” AND “muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle injury” OR “contraction-induced injury” OR “muscle soreness” OR “delayed onset muscle soreness” OR “creatine kinase.” From 1,092 originally identified titles, 36 studies were included which had an exercise component comparing a younger against an older group. The outcome variables of EIMD were muscle function, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase. A meta-analysis was conducted on change to EIMD after exercise in older versus younger adults using standardized mean difference (SMD) and an inverse-variance random effects model.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Change after 24 and 72 hr, and peak change, in muscle function was not different between old and young (SMD range = −0.16 to −0.35). Muscle soreness was greater in younger than older adults for all comparisons (SMD range = −0.34 to −0.62). Creatine kinase was greater in younger than older adults at 24 hr (SMD = −0.32), as was peak change (SMD = −0.32). A relationship between sex and peak muscle function change was evident for males (SMD = −0.45), but not females (SMD = −0.44). All other meta-regression was nonsignificant.
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    Advancing age is not associated with greater symptoms of EIMD. The implication of this study is that the older adults can pursue regular physical activity without concern for experiencing greater EIMD.

Abstract: 
                    
                      Objective
                      :
                    
                    Our research objectives were to evaluate the extent to which cognitive and physical performance in older adults, when fresh, and when fatigued vary with age and habitual physical activity.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    We employed experimental study designs, with between- (Study 1: age: 51–64 and 65–80 years and Study 2: habitual physical activity: active and sedentary) and within-participants factors (Study 1: test: before cognitive task and after cognitive task and Study 2: session: fatigue and control and test: before and after cognitive task). In testing sessions, participants performed exercise (6-min walk, 30-s sit stand, and 30-s arm curl) and cognitive (response inhibition and vigilance) tasks before and after a 20-min demanding cognitive task (time load dual back [TLDB] task). In Study 2, participants completed a paced breathing task (control session) as well as the TLDB (fatigue session). Ratings of mental fatigue and exercise-related perceived exertion were obtained.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    The 20-min TLDB task elicited a state of mental fatigue. Cognitive and physical performance was worse after than before the TLDB task. These impairments in performance were moderated by age (Study 1) and habitual physical activity (Study 2).
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    The deleterious effects of mental fatigue on cognitive and physical performance were accentuated by aging and attenuated by habitual physical activity.
                    
                      Implications
                      :
                    
                    Cognitive and/or physical training could mitigate the negative effects of mental fatigue on performance in older adults.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The goal was to explore the impact of fluctuating female sex hormone concentrations on the work rate delineating sustainable from unsustainable work rates at the heavy–severe domain boundary or maximal metabolic steady state (MMSS).
                  
                    METHODS: Thirty endurance trained participants (15 F / 15 M; V̇O
                    2MAX
                    48.1 ± 5.2 vs 57.3 ± 5.3 ml·min
                    −1
                    ·kg
                    −1
                    ; P = 0.001) completed four MMSS estimation protocols at distinct sex hormone profiles. Serum sex hormone concentrations, specifically estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, were determined during each study visit. To identify MMSS at each hormone profile, participants completed a muscle oxygenation (%SmO
                    2
                    ) zero-slope prediction cycling protocol once a week for four weeks. The %SmO
                    2
                    zero-slope protocol consisted of four, 4-min stages (2-min rest) spanning intensity domains. The work rate associated with MMSS was determined using linear regression analysis between workload and %SmO
                    2
                    signal slope during the final 2 min of each stage.
                  
                  RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed male sex to be a significant predictor of power at MMSS (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but changes in sex hormone concentrations were not associated with changes in MMSS work rate. No sex differences in MMSS were found when normalized to lean body mass (LBM) (P = 0.224) nor across the four visits (P = 0.074).
                  CONCLUSIONS: The LBM normalized work rate at MMSS was similar between men and women. Fluctuations in sex hormone profile in women were not associated with differences in the heavy–severe exercise domain boundary, nor were there any observed sex differences across distinct hormone profiles.
