Abstract: 
                    
                      Objective
                      :
                    
                    The aim of this paper was to undertake a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-accordant meta-analysis comparing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in older and younger adults.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    Google Scholar, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were searched in June 2023 for the terms “ageing” OR “age” OR “middle-aged” OR “old” OR “older” OR “elderly” OR “masters” OR “veteran” AND “muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle injury” OR “contraction-induced injury” OR “muscle soreness” OR “delayed onset muscle soreness” OR “creatine kinase.” From 1,092 originally identified titles, 36 studies were included which had an exercise component comparing a younger against an older group. The outcome variables of EIMD were muscle function, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase. A meta-analysis was conducted on change to EIMD after exercise in older versus younger adults using standardized mean difference (SMD) and an inverse-variance random effects model.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Change after 24 and 72 hr, and peak change, in muscle function was not different between old and young (SMD range = −0.16 to −0.35). Muscle soreness was greater in younger than older adults for all comparisons (SMD range = −0.34 to −0.62). Creatine kinase was greater in younger than older adults at 24 hr (SMD = −0.32), as was peak change (SMD = −0.32). A relationship between sex and peak muscle function change was evident for males (SMD = −0.45), but not females (SMD = −0.44). All other meta-regression was nonsignificant.
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    Advancing age is not associated with greater symptoms of EIMD. The implication of this study is that the older adults can pursue regular physical activity without concern for experiencing greater EIMD.

Abstract: 
                    We used stable isotope methodology to evaluate exogenous rates of CHO oxidation in elite male marathoners. We report that 120 (maltodextrin:fructose ratio 1:1) g·h

                    XX(X): 000–000, 2025—We compared an objective (velocity feedback [VEL]) vs. a subjective (rating of perceived exertion [RPE]) autoregulatory method to estimate velocity drop thresholds associated with low (10%), moderate (20%) metabolic fatigue, and muscular endurance (40%) during continuous sets in the back squat (BSQ) exercise using either 50% or 75% of the 1 repetition maximum (1RM). After five sessions of familiarization and determining the 1RM, 19 male subjects (24.5 ± 6 years) and 9 female subjects (30.4 ± 8 years) underwent two identical 6-day testing sessions over 2 weeks (12 sessions) using the VEL (first 6 sessions) or the RPE method (last 6 sessions). The assessments of velocity thresholds and relative loads were randomized for each 6-day testing period. The average velocity (AV) and the OMNI-RES (0–10) scale scores were measured for every repetition of each set. Under VEL, sets ended after completing two consecutive repetitions below the target threshold. A linear mixed-effects model setting velocity thresholds, method, and their interaction as fixed effects, and subjects as random components, was conducted. Although no significant differences between methods were identified for the percentage of velocity decrease and the total number of repetitions completed per set, compared with VEL, under the RPE method, fewer repetitions were completed below the thresholds for both 50 and 75% 1RM (
                    p
                    &amp;lt; 0.01 and
                    g
                    &amp;gt; 1 in all cases). In conclusion, both methods, VEL and RPE, seem useful for estimating velocity changes during continuous sets of BSQ. However, the RPE method allowed for fewer unnecessary repetitions when squatting until 10, 20, and 40% of velocity decrease.

Abstract: In males with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 30–70% have a coronary artery calcification (CAC) score &amp;gt;1 in their thirties. The data in this case report indicate zero detectable CAC in a 30–39-yr-old male with T1D who followed a ketogenic diet for 10 years despite having an elevated low-density lipoprotein and no lipid-lowering medication. This suggests an absence of atherosclerotic plaque formation, despite concerns about the long-term cardiovascular consequences of a ketogenic diet.
