Abstract: 
                    
                      Objective
                      :
                    
                    The aim of this paper was to undertake a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-accordant meta-analysis comparing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in older and younger adults.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    Google Scholar, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were searched in June 2023 for the terms “ageing” OR “age” OR “middle-aged” OR “old” OR “older” OR “elderly” OR “masters” OR “veteran” AND “muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle damage” OR “exercise-induced muscle injury” OR “contraction-induced injury” OR “muscle soreness” OR “delayed onset muscle soreness” OR “creatine kinase.” From 1,092 originally identified titles, 36 studies were included which had an exercise component comparing a younger against an older group. The outcome variables of EIMD were muscle function, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase. A meta-analysis was conducted on change to EIMD after exercise in older versus younger adults using standardized mean difference (SMD) and an inverse-variance random effects model.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Change after 24 and 72 hr, and peak change, in muscle function was not different between old and young (SMD range = −0.16 to −0.35). Muscle soreness was greater in younger than older adults for all comparisons (SMD range = −0.34 to −0.62). Creatine kinase was greater in younger than older adults at 24 hr (SMD = −0.32), as was peak change (SMD = −0.32). A relationship between sex and peak muscle function change was evident for males (SMD = −0.45), but not females (SMD = −0.44). All other meta-regression was nonsignificant.
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    Advancing age is not associated with greater symptoms of EIMD. The implication of this study is that the older adults can pursue regular physical activity without concern for experiencing greater EIMD.

Abstract: 
                    
                      Background
                      :
                    
                    The role of high-volume low-intensity training for enhancing endurance performance has gained growing interest in recent years. Specifically, so-called “zone 2 training” is currently receiving much attention, and many propose that this is the target intensity at which a large proportion of total endurance training should be performed. However, despite the popularity of this concept, there is no clear consensus among coaches, athletes, and scientists regarding the definition of zone 2 training.
                    
                      Purpose
                      :
                    
                    This commentary summarizes the perspectives, experience, and knowledge of an expert panel of 14 applied sport scientists and professional coaches with the aim of providing insight and a basis for definitional consensus on zone 2 training. Moreover, potential training strategies at this intensity are proposed, and the expected physiological adaptations when exercising at this intensity and related research gaps are also discussed.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Experts reached consensus that zone 2 training should preferably be performed at intensities located immediately below the first lactate or ventilatory threshold through continuous, variable, or interval-type sessions. Furthermore, experts expected a broad range of central and peripheral adaptations from zone 2 training. These expected adaptations might not be unique to zone 2 and could also be induced with sessions performed at slightly higher and lower intensities.
                    
                      Conclusions
                      :
                    
                    This commentary provides practical insight and unified criteria regarding the preferred intensity, duration, and session type for the optimization of zone 2 training based on the perspectives of acknowledged sport scientists and professional coaches.

Abstract: 
                    
                      Background/Objectives
                      :
                    
                    Physical fitness screening measures for older athletes are lacking in clinical and research arenas. This study aims to define the Sustained Athlete Fitness Exam (SAFE), a comprehensive tool developed using age and sex-based normative data from U.S. National Senior Games athletes, and to investigate any SAFE differences by age, sex, sport, or exercise volume.
                    
                      Methods
                      :
                    
                    This cross-sectional study engaged 4,659 U.S. National Senior Games athletes (
                    M
                    age
                     = 67.65,
                    SD
                     = 9.12, 59.1% female). Athletes completed health history questions and physical performance measures addressing cardiovascular, muscular, flexibility, and balance subscales. Scoring applied age and sex norms from the study population. Outcomes were compared by age group, sex, sport, and exercise volume.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    All 22 National Senior Games sports were represented in the study population. Health histories revealed low rates of chronic conditions, with 28.5% reporting none. Median weekly cardiovascular and resistance exercise volumes were 240 and 30 min, respectively. Of the 20 points possible on the SAFE, scores ranged from 2 (0.2%) to 20 (0.8%), with a median of 13. SAFE scoring demonstrated minimal differences by age group or sex and aligned predictably by sport. Higher exercise volumes were associated with superior SAFE composite scores, with nearly all subscales following this trend.
                    
                      Conclusion
                      :
                    
                    The SAFE and associated norms offer population-specific comparisons previously unavailable for older athletes, with a tool able to address multiple domains of physical fitness while avoiding ceiling and floor effects.
                    
                      Significance/Implications
                      :
                    
                    These findings provide the opportunity to improve assessment, treatment, preventative medicine, and training support for a growing demographic.

Abstract: 
                    We evaluated the effects of carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion at rates of 60 (maltodextrin:fructose ratio 1:0), 90 (2:1), and 120 (1:1) g·h⁻¹ on whole body substrate metabolism, exogenous CHO oxidation (via U-

                    ), participants completed 120-minute running trials comprising 15 mins at 95% lactate threshold (LT), 90 mins at 94% lactate turnpoint and a final 15 mins at 95% LT. Mean whole body CHO oxidation (120 g·h

                    . Running economy was improved in the 120 g·h⁻¹ condition, with a 2.6% lower O₂ cost compared to 60 g·h⁻¹ ( P = 0.021). The incidence of moderate or severe (≥4) GI symptoms was high in all trials, though peak symptoms of nausea, stomach fullness and abdominal cramps were greatest for 120 g·h

                    confers a metabolic advantage to male marathoners by better maintaining whole-body rates of CHO oxidation, increasing exogenous CHO oxidation and improving running economy. However, gut training strategies, preceding practical application, are warranted.

Abstract: The sport of tennis involves unique nutritional demands for the physical and technical aspects of match play and training, as well as the nutritional challenges associated with extensive travel and a lengthy competition calendar. An expert group assembled by The International Tennis Federation, the Women’s Tennis Association, and the Association of Tennis Professionals has produced a scientific review of current evidence to inform practical recommendations for high-performance tennis. The narrative summary considers the diversity within the tennis community, including male and female players, youth players, and wheelchair players. The Expert Group Statement addresses nine specific topics: (a) introduction to tennis; (b) physiological characteristics of tennis training and match play; (c) training nutrition; (d) body composition, low energy availability, and relative energy deficiency in sport; (e) match-day nutrition; (f) dietary supplements for tennis performance; (g) environmental and travel issues; (h) nutrition guidelines during periods of illness and injury rehabilitation; and (i) special population groups. The statement advocates for an evidence-based approach to nutrition in high-performance tennis and emphasizes a “food first” philosophy, prioritizing food over supplements to meet nutrient requirements effectively. In recognition of the benefits of sound nutrition, strategies in supporting health and performance over a player’s career, academies, national federations, and international organizations are encouraged to engage professionals with appropriate nutrition-related qualifications and professional registrations to support players effectively.
