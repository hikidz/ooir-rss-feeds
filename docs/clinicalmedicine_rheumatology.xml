Abstract: ObjectiveThis study characterized the impact of voclosporin on kidney histology in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) who had protocolized repeat kidney biopsies in the AURORA clinical trials.MethodsPatients were randomized to voclosporin or placebo treatment for up to 3 years; all patients received mycophenolate mofetil and low‐dose glucocorticoids. Patients had baseline kidney biopsies within 6 months before study start and repeat biopsies after approximately 18 months of study treatment. The revised National Institutes of Health indices for LN activity and chronicity (CI) were calculated in addition to a semiquantitative assessment of vascular and tubular lesions.ResultsSixteen patients in the voclosporin group and 10 patients in the control group had both baseline and repeat kidney biopsies. Patient clinical characteristics were similar at baseline. In the voclosporin group, most (n = 13) patients had pure class IV lesions (pure class V, n = 1; mixed, n = 2). In the control group, three patients had pure class IV (pure class III, n = 3; pure class V, n = 1; mixed, n = 3). Most of the voclosporin‐treated patients had no change in CI (n = 8) or a change no greater than 2 (n = 6); control‐treated patients also had no change in CI (n = 3) or a change no greater than 2 (n = 6). No trends in vascular lesions or tubular compartment changes were observed.ConclusionOutcomes from this small subgroup show that exposure to study treatment was not associated with nephrotoxicity based on histopathologic evaluation after 18 months. These data are reassuring and further contribute to the safety profile of voclosporin for the treatment of adults with active LN.

Abstract: ObjectiveWe estimated the real‐world cost‐effectiveness of a standardized education and exercise therapy program (GLA:D) compared to usual care (UC) for people managing hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (HKOA).MethodsWe used a prospective matched cohort design to recruit people (aged &amp;gt;45 years) diagnosed with HKOA who used GLA:D or UC (not on a surgical waitlist) throughout Alberta, Canada. Demographics, pain, function, quality of life, and an HKOA‐related cost questionnaire were administered over 12 months. The primary Ministry of Health (MOH) perspective used administrative data to estimate all public health care costs. The secondary health care perspective included MOH, private insurance, and out‐of‐pocket costs. We calculated our cost‐effectiveness measure, incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) in Canadian dollars, over 12 months with a $30,000/quality‐adjusted life years (QALY) willingness to pay threshold and adjusted for the differences between cohorts. A Markov model was used to extend INMB over a lifetime time horizon (3% discounting). Model uncertainty was explored by probabilistic sensitivity analyses.ResultsA total of 254 participants (GLA:D n = 127, UC n = 127; 72% female), with a mean age of 64.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.1–65.5), diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis (63%), hip osteoarthritis (24%), or both (13%) were observed for a mean of 5.5 years (95% CI: 4.8–6.3). The adjusted INMB of GLA:D compared to UC was $6,065 (95% CI: $3,648–$8,482) and $499 (95% CI: −$2,913 to $3,912) from an MOH and health care perspective over 12 months and $6,574 and $1,775 over a lifetime with 54% and 51% probability of being cost‐effective using a threshold of willingness to pay of $30,000 per QALY.ConclusionsGLA:D had a positive INMB compared to UC from the MOH perspective over 12 months. The INMB remained positive but was less certain over a lifetime or when out‐of‐pocket and private insurance costs were considered.

Abstract: BackgroundThe optimal treatment strategy for rheumatoid arthritis‐associated interstitial lung disease (RA‐ILD) remains uncertain, and direct comparative data between biologics is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of abatacept compared with rituximab in patients with RA‐ILD.MethodsAn emulated target trial was designed using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network database, including patients with RA‐ILD, diagnosed between 2007 and 2024. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups (abatacept and rituximab). The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included respiratory events, medical utilization, and infection‐related adverse events. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to use Cox proportional hazards models.Results1,615 patients per group were identified after matching for analysis. Abatacept was associated with a significantly lower risk of all‐cause mortality compared with rituximab (HR 0.689, 95% CI 0.581–0.818) and a reduced risk of mechanical ventilation (HR 0.698, 95% CI 0.521–0.934). The subgroup analyses yielded consistent findings. Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with concomitant connective tissue diseases also demonstrated consistent results (mortality, HR 0.679, 95% CI 0.570–0.810), reinforcing the robustness of the findings.ConclusionAbatacept was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared with rituximab in patients with RA‐ILD. Because clinicians may preferentially reserve abatacept for less aggressive RA‐ILD, residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded; thus, the association should not be interpreted as proof of causality. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm whether abatacept confers a true survival advantage.image

Abstract: ObjectiveWe assessed race, ethnicity, and geographic diversity in pivotal trials of biologic and targeted synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs approved for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the United States.MethodsWe conducted a descriptive epidemiologic study, examining the reporting and representation of race, ethnicity, and geographic distribution of trial sites in pivotal PsA trials using data from journal publications, the Drugs@FDA database, and ClinicalTrials.gov.ResultsWe identified 29 pivotal PsA trials for 16 targeted therapies with start dates between 2000 and 2019. Race data were reported in 93% of trials. Race reporting was highest in journal publications (86%); however, among these, 46% reported only the proportion of White participants. Ethnicity data were available for 41% of trials, primarily from ClinicalTrials.gov, with improved reporting in recent years. Among 14,165 participants in 27 trials with race data, 92% were White, 7% were Asian, and fewer than 1% were Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Among 8,105 participants in 12 trials with ethnicity data, 11% were Hispanic or Latino individuals. Location data were available for 26 trials. In the United States, trial activity was highest in Texas (24 trials), Florida and Pennsylvania (22 each), and California (20), strongly correlating with state population size (r = 0.78, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). Globally, trial sites were identified in 55 countries, primarily in North America and Europe, with fewer sites in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.ConclusionRacial and ethnic diversity in pivotal PsA trials remains limited. Tailored and multifaceted strategies are needed to improve participant representativeness in future trials.
