Abstract: ObjectiveAntinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are present at high titers in 2% of the general population but their clinical significance in individuals without an autoimmune (AI) disease is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of a high ANA titer in non‐ AI conditions is associated with disease.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective case‐control study in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's de‐identified electronic medical record system. Individuals without AI disease who had an ANA test were classified into 3 groups: high titer (HT, ANA≥1:640), low titer (LT, ANA≤1:80), and negative ANA (NG). The prevalence of diagnoses recorded within 90 days of the ANA test were compared among groups in a phenome‐wide association study (PheWAS) adjusting for age at ANA testing, sex, median body mass index (BMI), and reported race. A P‐value &amp;lt;5x10‐5 was considered significant.ResultsA total of 28,781 individuals qualified for the study: 3.1% in the HT, 12.3% in the LT, and 84.6% in the NG groups. BMI was similar between groups (P‐value=0.345), but individuals in the HT group were older (P=3.9x10‐73). A high ANA titer increased risk of 46 and 67 clinical diagnoses when comparing the HT group with the LT and the NG groups, respectively. The most significant associations in both comparisons included liver disorders/complications and risk factors for liver disease.ConclusionsA high ANA titer in the absence of an AI disease was associated with increased risk of liver disorders and related risk factors and complications.image

Abstract: ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare differences in clinical response, drug survival, and adverse event rates between anakinra and canakinumab in VEXAS syndrome.MethodsThis multicenter international study includes VEXAS patients from France, Israel, and Italy treated with IL1 inhibition (IL1i). Global response (GR) was defined as the absence of inflammatory symptoms, 50% or greater decrease in steroid dose and C‐reactive protein. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify associated variables. Drug survival was analyzed using Kaplan‐Meier plots and log‐rank test, with Cox‐regression models for associated factors.ResultsWe included 47 male VEXAS patients; 44 received anakinra, and 9 received canakinumab, with 6 patients using both at different time points. GR at 1 month was 34% for anakinra and 100% for canakinumab (p&amp;lt;0.001), 22% and 78% at 3 months, respectively (p=0.001).Treatment with canakinumab was associated with higher odds ratio (OR) of achieving GR at 3 months (OR 28.8, 95%CI 3·0‐273·9, p=0.004) in a multivariable analysis. Median drug survival was 54 (30‐56) months for canakinumab at 300 mg/month, compared to 7 (4‐8) months for canakinumab 150 mg/month and 1 (1‐2.5) months for anakinra (p=0.01). Injection site reactions were only recorded for the anakinra group (47 vs 0%; p=0.006), whereas infections were more frequent in the anakinra group (31% and 11%; p=0·3).ConclusionsCanakinumab demonstrated superior clinical response and drug survival with fewer adverse events compared to anakinra. Monthly Canakinumab 300 mg may be considered as an effective steroid‐sparing therapeutic option for VEXAS patients.image

Abstract: Abstract
               
                  Objectives
                  Treatment of GCA still requires substantial exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are associated with significant toxicity. This study compares the efficacy and safety of the GC-only standard of care (SOC) with a regimen combining intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulses, MTX and lower doses of prednisone, in newly diagnosed patients with GCA.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A usual clinical practice study was conducted in three Spanish academic hospitals. One hundred and fifty-one patients diagnosed with GCA were treated with SOC prednisone (40–60 mg/d) or with IVMP (125–500 mg/d ×3) followed by lower-dose prednisone (≤30 mg/d) and MTX (IVMP/MTX), with a follow-up of 2 years. A propensity score was used to adjust for baseline differences in the multivariate analyses.
               
               
                  Results
                  Seventy-nine (52.3%) patients received SOC prednisone and 72 (47.7%) IVMP/MTX. The clinical characteristics at baseline were similar in both the groups. Hundred percent patients achieved remission after a median time of 4 weeks, without differences between the groups. Relapse rates were also similar. Patients receiving IVMP/MTX had significantly lower cumulative GC doses and reached prednisone ≤5 mg/d faster than SOC patients (mean 13.8 vs 56.5 weeks; P &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients in the IVMP/MTX group were less likely to suffer any GC-related adverse effect (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14–0.85; P = 0.021).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The combination IVMP/MTX with lower-dose prednisone is as effective as the SOC in inducing remission and preventing relapses in GCA. The IVMP/MTX scheme significantly reduces GC exposure and GC-associated adverse effects. IVMP/MTX could be a potential GC-sparing strategy, especially in patients with GCA at higher risk of GC toxicity.
