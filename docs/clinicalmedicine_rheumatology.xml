Abstract: ObjectiveMultiple plant‐based dietary patterns are inversely associated with gout, although the individual constituents driving this association remain unclear. Dietary lignans, a major group of phytoestrogens abundant in plant foods, are metabolized by the gut microflora and may modulate gout risk. We examined the associations between dietary lignan intake, certain whole grain foods rich in lignans, and incident gout.MethodsWe analyzed data from 122,680 individuals in the Health Professionals Follow‐up Study and Nurses’ Health Study. We administered a food frequency questionnaire every 2‐4 years. We used Cox models to evaluate associations between dietary lignans, whole grain foods, and confirmed gout.ResultsHigher intakes of matairesinol (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] comparing extreme quintiles: 0.78 [0.69, 0.90]; P trend=0.002) and secoisolariciresinol (0.78 [0.68, 0.89]; P trend=0.002) were both associated with lower gout risk, while pinoresinol and lariciresinol were not associated with gout. We found inverse associations of whole grain cold breakfast cereals (HR for those consuming ≥1 serving/day 0.62 [0.53, 0.73]), cooked oatmeal/oat bran (HR for those consuming ≥2 servings/week 0.78 [0.70, 0.86]), and bran added to food (HR for those consuming ≥2 servings/week 0.84 [0.74, 0.95]), but not dark breads or other cooked breakfast cereals, with gout.ConclusionHigher intakes of matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, as well as whole grain cold breakfast cereals, oatmeal, and added bran, were each significantly associated with lower gout risk. These findings support adherence to healthful plant‐based diets for gout and suggest a potential role of the gut microbiome in gout pathogenesis.

Abstract: ObjectiveThis study characterized the impact of voclosporin on kidney histology in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) who had protocolized repeat kidney biopsies in the AURORA clinical trials.MethodsPatients were randomized to voclosporin or placebo treatment for up to 3 years; all patients received mycophenolate mofetil and low‐dose glucocorticoids. Patients had baseline kidney biopsies within 6 months before study start and repeat biopsies after approximately 18 months of study treatment. The revised National Institutes of Health indices for LN activity and chronicity (CI) were calculated in addition to a semiquantitative assessment of vascular and tubular lesions.ResultsSixteen patients in the voclosporin group and 10 patients in the control group had both baseline and repeat kidney biopsies. Patient clinical characteristics were similar at baseline. In the voclosporin group, most (n = 13) patients had pure class IV lesions (pure class V, n = 1; mixed, n = 2). In the control group, three patients had pure class IV (pure class III, n = 3; pure class V, n = 1; mixed, n = 3). Most of the voclosporin‐treated patients had no change in CI (n = 8) or a change no greater than 2 (n = 6); control‐treated patients also had no change in CI (n = 3) or a change no greater than 2 (n = 6). No trends in vascular lesions or tubular compartment changes were observed.ConclusionOutcomes from this small subgroup show that exposure to study treatment was not associated with nephrotoxicity based on histopathologic evaluation after 18 months. These data are reassuring and further contribute to the safety profile of voclosporin for the treatment of adults with active LN.

Abstract: ObjectiveWe estimated the real‐world cost‐effectiveness of a standardized education and exercise therapy program (GLA:D) compared to usual care (UC) for people managing hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (HKOA).MethodsWe used a prospective matched cohort design to recruit people (aged &amp;gt;45 years) diagnosed with HKOA who used GLA:D or UC (not on a surgical waitlist) throughout Alberta, Canada. Demographics, pain, function, quality of life, and an HKOA‐related cost questionnaire were administered over 12 months. The primary Ministry of Health (MOH) perspective used administrative data to estimate all public health care costs. The secondary health care perspective included MOH, private insurance, and out‐of‐pocket costs. We calculated our cost‐effectiveness measure, incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) in Canadian dollars, over 12 months with a $30,000/quality‐adjusted life years (QALY) willingness to pay threshold and adjusted for the differences between cohorts. A Markov model was used to extend INMB over a lifetime time horizon (3% discounting). Model uncertainty was explored by probabilistic sensitivity analyses.ResultsA total of 254 participants (GLA:D n = 127, UC n = 127; 72% female), with a mean age of 64.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.1–65.5), diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis (63%), hip osteoarthritis (24%), or both (13%) were observed for a mean of 5.5 years (95% CI: 4.8–6.3). The adjusted INMB of GLA:D compared to UC was $6,065 (95% CI: $3,648–$8,482) and $499 (95% CI: −$2,913 to $3,912) from an MOH and health care perspective over 12 months and $6,574 and $1,775 over a lifetime with 54% and 51% probability of being cost‐effective using a threshold of willingness to pay of $30,000 per QALY.ConclusionsGLA:D had a positive INMB compared to UC from the MOH perspective over 12 months. The INMB remained positive but was less certain over a lifetime or when out‐of‐pocket and private insurance costs were considered.

Abstract: 
            Purpose of review
            This review highlights recent advances in the understanding and management of gastrointestinal manifestations in systemic sclerosis (SSc). It is intended for clinicians and researchers aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies in managing SSc-related gastrointestinal disease.
          
          
            Recent findings
            Gastrointestinal involvement in SSc is highly variable in terms of clinical presentation, symptom severity, progression, timing of onset, and response to treatment. Emerging research highlights early immune-mediated damage to neural and muscular gastrointestinal tissues, microbiome alterations, and vascular dysfunction – particularly in patients with late-onset gastrointestinal disease – as key factors guiding the development of personalized, precision-based approaches for well defined patient subgroups. Recent studies underscore the value of early, objective assessment of gastrointestinal motility using tools like whole-gut transit scintigraphy and abdominal vascular ultrasound. New treatment strategies are also being explored for severe manifestations, including investigating mechanisms behind acid-suppressive therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease and implementing adjunctive therapies for gastrointestinal dysmotility.
          
          
            Summary
            Gastrointestinal involvement in SSc poses a complex clinical challenge, particularly in patients with severe dysmotility and symptoms refractory to standard management strategies. This review offers timely, evidence-based insights to support clinicians in delivering more personalized and effective patient care and highlights critical gaps to address in future research.
