Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Objective
                    The objective of this study was to examine whether foot/ankle injury and injection contribute to the risk of foot/ankle OA in retired UK male professional footballers.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    This was a case–control study among retired UK male footballers, in which cases reported General Practitioner–diagnosed foot/ankle OA or forefoot/ankle surgery after retirement, and controls reported neither. Injury was defined as significant foot/ankle injury with pain for most days over 3 months during their career. Injection was defined as injection of corticosteroids or other agents into foot/ankle joints during their career. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression. Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) and 95% CIs were estimated to examine the contribution of injury and/or injection in the context of other available risk factors.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Of 424 footballers studied, 63 had foot/ankle OA and 361 had neither. Cases had similar mean age (63.2 vs 63.0, P = 0.457) and BMI (27.7 vs 27.0, P = 0.240) to those of controls, but more foot/ankle injury (73.3% vs 42.5%, P &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and injections (75.0% vs 48.4%, P &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), with aORs of 4.23 (95% CI 1.88–9.48) and 2.62 (95% CI 1.19–5.78), respectively. The AUC was 0.69 (95% CI 0.62–0.77) for injury, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66–0.81) for injury and injection, and 0.78 (95% CI 0.70–0.85) for all risk factors. Similar results were observed in footballers with ankle OA only.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Injury was a major risk factor for foot/ankle OA in retired UK male professional footballers. The role of injection needs cautious interpretation due to potential confounding by indication.

Abstract: ObjectiveAntinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are present at high titers in 2% of the general population but their clinical significance in individuals without an autoimmune (AI) disease is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of a high ANA titer in non‐ AI conditions is associated with disease.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective case‐control study in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's de‐identified electronic medical record system. Individuals without AI disease who had an ANA test were classified into 3 groups: high titer (HT, ANA≥1:640), low titer (LT, ANA≤1:80), and negative ANA (NG). The prevalence of diagnoses recorded within 90 days of the ANA test were compared among groups in a phenome‐wide association study (PheWAS) adjusting for age at ANA testing, sex, median body mass index (BMI), and reported race. A P‐value &amp;lt;5x10‐5 was considered significant.ResultsA total of 28,781 individuals qualified for the study: 3.1% in the HT, 12.3% in the LT, and 84.6% in the NG groups. BMI was similar between groups (P‐value=0.345), but individuals in the HT group were older (P=3.9x10‐73). A high ANA titer increased risk of 46 and 67 clinical diagnoses when comparing the HT group with the LT and the NG groups, respectively. The most significant associations in both comparisons included liver disorders/complications and risk factors for liver disease.ConclusionsA high ANA titer in the absence of an AI disease was associated with increased risk of liver disorders and related risk factors and complications.image
