Abstract: BackgroundIndividuals with serum elevations of anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‐CCP) antibodies are at increased risk for future rheumatoid arthritis (RA). No pharmacologic interventions have been approved for the prevention of RA in such ‘at‐risk’ individuals. However, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used without supporting clinical trial evidence.MethodsIn this phase 2 randomized trial, individuals at‐risk for RA with anti‐CCP ≥2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were assigned to receive HCQ or placebo for 12 months, with up to 24 months of post‐drug follow‐up. The primary outcome was the development of clinical RA, as defined in the protocol, at 36 months. Secondary outcomes included safety, development of inflammatory arthritis (IA), and participant‐reported joint symptoms.ResultsOf 144 randomized participants, 71 were assigned to HCQ and 73 to placebo. In the modified intent‐to‐treat population, clinical RA occurred in 21 of 69 (30.4%) participants in the HCQ group and 24 of 73 (32.9%) in the placebo group. The risk of clinical RA at 36 months was 0.336 with HCQ and 0.394 with placebo (difference ‐0.058; 95% confidence interval ‐0.336 to 0.220; P=0.52). Results for IA were similar. The occurrence and severity of joint symptoms were not observed to differ between groups. Adverse event incidence was similar between groups.ConclusionsIn this trial involving individuals with anti‐CCP levels ≥2 times the ULN, 12 months of HCQ did not prevent the development of clinical RA at 36 months.

Abstract: ObjectiveImaging evidence of active sacroiliitis is important for diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, there is no consistent guidance on whether patients should temporarily stop nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to determine whether NSAIDs lead to an underestimation of active sacroiliitis, as observed using MRI.MethodsAdults with axSpA were recruited from rheumatology clinics and undertook NSAID washout for one to two weeks before a sacroiliac joint MRI scan. Images were read by two independent readers and adjudicated by a third if required. Those who had a positive result for active sacroiliitis, as per internationally recognized criteria, underwent a second scan six weeks after recommencing daily NSAIDs. We determined the proportion of participants who had a negative scanning result while taking NSAIDs after a previous positive result when NSAID‐free. Images were also scored using semiquantitative methods comprising lesion size and intensity, and a subset of participants underwent quantitative MRI (qMRI) to provide an objective evaluation of any inflammatory changes.ResultsFrom 34 centers across the United Kingdom, 311 participants (median age 42 years; 62% male) were recruited; 286 (92%) completed the NSAID washout and underwent the first MRI scan. From 146 participants with active sacroiliitis, follow‐up scans (while taking NSAIDs) were obtained from 124 (85%), at which point 25 participants had a negative result (20.2%; 95% confidence interval 13.5%–28.3%). Semiquantitative and qMRI methods supported these findings.ConclusionOne‐fifth of patients showed full resolution of active sacroiliitis lesions when NSAIDs were present. In clinical practice, if patients with axSpA are willing to attempt a one‐ to two‐week NSAID washout before MRI, this should be considered.

Abstract: ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare differences in clinical response, drug survival, and adverse event rates between anakinra and canakinumab in VEXAS syndrome.MethodsThis multicenter international study includes VEXAS patients from France, Israel, and Italy treated with IL1 inhibition (IL1i). Global response (GR) was defined as the absence of inflammatory symptoms, 50% or greater decrease in steroid dose and C‐reactive protein. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify associated variables. Drug survival was analyzed using Kaplan‐Meier plots and log‐rank test, with Cox‐regression models for associated factors.ResultsWe included 47 male VEXAS patients; 44 received anakinra, and 9 received canakinumab, with 6 patients using both at different time points. GR at 1 month was 34% for anakinra and 100% for canakinumab (p&amp;lt;0.001), 22% and 78% at 3 months, respectively (p=0.001).Treatment with canakinumab was associated with higher odds ratio (OR) of achieving GR at 3 months (OR 28.8, 95%CI 3·0‐273·9, p=0.004) in a multivariable analysis. Median drug survival was 54 (30‐56) months for canakinumab at 300 mg/month, compared to 7 (4‐8) months for canakinumab 150 mg/month and 1 (1‐2.5) months for anakinra (p=0.01). Injection site reactions were only recorded for the anakinra group (47 vs 0%; p=0.006), whereas infections were more frequent in the anakinra group (31% and 11%; p=0·3).ConclusionsCanakinumab demonstrated superior clinical response and drug survival with fewer adverse events compared to anakinra. Monthly Canakinumab 300 mg may be considered as an effective steroid‐sparing therapeutic option for VEXAS patients.image
