Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    Objective
                    This study examined the impact of a 2‐week eucaloric diet high in ultraprocessed foods (UPF) compared to a diet without UPF (non‐UPF) on ad libitum energy intake (EI) and food selection in individuals aged 18–25.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In a randomized, crossover, proof‐of‐concept trial, participants completed two 14‐day controlled feeding periods (81% UPF vs. 0% UPF), with a 4‐week washout. Diets were matched for macronutrients, fiber, added sugar, diet quality, and energy density. Following each condition, participants consumed an ad libitum buffet meal including UPF and non‐UPF. Energy and food grams consumed were quantified. Statistical analyses were conducted for the full sample, late adolescents (aged 18–21), and young adults (aged 22–25).
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Twenty‐seven individuals aged 22 ± 2 years (mean BMI = 24 ± 3 kg/m
                      2
                      ) were included. Diet compliance was ~99% overall. There was no effect of diet condition on meal total kcal or grams consumed or UPF or non‐UPF consumption in the full sample (all
                      p
                       &amp;gt; 0.05). In the exploratory age subgroup analysis, an interaction between diet and age was observed for total EI (
                      p
                       &amp;lt; 0.001), where total EI increased among adolescents following the UPF diet (
                      p
                       = 0.03,
                      d
                       = 0.79), but not in young adults.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Late adolescents may be susceptible to increased EI following a UPF diet. Future trials are warranted to evaluate this possibility.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Context
                    Maternal thyroid hormones are essential for fetal neurodevelopment. Gestational thyroid imbalance has been associated with atypical neurodevelopment, including increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    To examine the association between maternal thyroid dysfunction and ASD risk in offspring.
                  
                  
                    Design
                    Retrospective cohort study with follow-up through January 2021.
                  
                  
                    Setting
                    Single tertiary hospital in southern Israel (Soroka University Medical Center); linked to Clalit Health Services electronic records.
                  
                  
                    Patients or Other Participants
                    A total of 51 296 singleton births between January 2011 and December 2017.
                  
                  
                    Intervention(s)
                    None.
                  
                  
                    Main Outcome Measure(s)
                    Offspring ASD diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition).
                  
                  
                    Results
                    A total of 4409 (8.6%) of the mothers showed abnormal thyroid function. ASD cumulative incidence was similar in the offspring of women with normal and abnormal thyroid function (log-rank P = .27). While chronic hypothyroidism only (reflecting likely adequate treatment) was not significantly associated with ASD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.15-1.48], combined chronic and gestational hypothyroidism was associated with higher ASD risk (aHR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.44-4.74). Trimester-specific analysis indicated a dose-response effect, in which the longer the period of hypothyroidism, the higher the ASD risk, namely, for 1, 2, or 3 trimesters of exposure: aHR, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.19-2.83); aHR, 2.39 (95% CI, 1.24-5.78); aHR, 3.25 (95% CI, 1.07-7.21), respectively.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    The findings suggest adequately treated chronic hypothyroidism is not associated with ASD in offspring, whereas persistent hormonal imbalance across trimesters conveys elevated risk. These findings underscore the importance of routine thyroid function screening and timely treatment throughout pregnancy.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    In the past, fingernail and toenail analyses were mainly used for toxicological investigations on heavy metals and only a few studies used mineral content as a biomarker for assessing lifestyle or dietary habits. The Fulda NutriNAIL study examined associations between lifestyle, dietary habits, supplement use, and fingernail mineral composition in 184 participants (18–81 years) from Fulda, Germany. Mineral concentrations were quantified via Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP‐MS), and questionnaire data were analyzed for lifestyle correlations. Positive mineral‐to‐mineral correlations were observed between sodium (Na) and potassium (K) (
                    r
                     = 0.89), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) (
                    r
                     = 0.57), and iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) (
                    r
                     = 0.66). We detected 21% higher selenium levels in the fingernails of selenium supplement users than for non‐users. Omnivores showed higher Se levels than vegans and slightly higher levels than vegetarians and participants with thyroid disorders had significantly higher nail selenium levels. In addition, nail surface features were linked to specific mineral differences: potassium in brittle nails, reduced sodium and potassium in longitudinal ridges, and reduced chromium (Cr) in white spots. These findings demonstrate that fingernail mineral profiling is a non‐invasive method for assessing lifestyle‐ and diet‐related micronutrient status.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  Since the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, obesity has been consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes. In 2020, we hypothesized that adipose tissue (AT) might serve as a viral reservoir and amplifier of immune responses in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Five years on, accumulating evidence supports this hypothesis. Recent autopsy and in vitro studies support that SARS‐CoV‐2 disseminates to and may replicate within human adipocytes. While several studies have detected SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and proteins in AT, the recovery of infectious virus from this tissue has not yet been demonstrated. This remains a critical gap in our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral tropism and replication within adipocytes. Viral entry is mediated via angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 and neuropilin‐1 receptors. Infected AT exhibits immune cell infiltration and cytokine activation, implicating it in systemic inflammation. Persistent viral RNA in AT correlates with prolonged metabolic dysfunction. These findings highlight the dual role of AT as a potential viral reservoir and immunometabolic organ. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to mitigating the long‐term impact of COVID‐19 and guiding responses to future pandemics involving metabolically active tissues.
