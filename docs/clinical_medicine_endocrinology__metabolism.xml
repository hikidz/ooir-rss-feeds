Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Context
                    Metformin is the first-line pharmacotherapy for treating hyperglycemia, and it lowers cardiovascular disease risk. Prior work suggests that metformin can, however, interfere with metabolic adaptations to exercise. To date, no work has tested if metformin (Met) alters exercise training mediated vascular insulin sensitivity, and whether this is exercise intensity dependent.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    This work aimed to test the hypothesis that Met blunts vascular insulin sensitivity in an intensity-based manner among adults at risk for metabolic syndrome.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants were randomly assigned to low-intensity exercise plus placebo (∼55% VO2max 5d/wk, LoEx + PL, n = 22) or metformin (2000 mg/d, LoEx + Met, n = 21) and high-intensity exercise plus placebo (∼85% VO2max 5d/wk, HiEx + PL, n = 24) or metformin (HiEx + Met, n = 24) for 16 weeks. A 120-minute euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mU/m2/min, 90 mg/dL) was conducted pre and post treatment to assess macrovascular insulin sensitivity via brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (%FMD, conduit artery) as well as microvascular insulin sensitivity using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (eg, microvascular blood volume [MBV, perfusion] and microvascular blood flow [MBF]). Fasting and clamp-derived glucose, insulin, inflammatory measures (eg, endothelin-1 [ET-1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products [sRAGE]), and nitric oxide (nitrite/nitrate) were assessed. Aerobic fitness (maximal oxygen consumption [VO2max]) and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) were also analyzed.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    LoEx + PL and HiEx + PL increased VO2max (both P &amp;amp;lt; .05), while there was no change after LoEx + Met or HiEx + Met. Body fat was reduced following HiEx + PL and HiEx + Met only (both P &amp;amp;lt; .05). Met blunted the increase in insulin-stimulated FMDallometric and MBF seen with LoEx + PL and HiEx + PL (P &amp;amp;lt; .05). Met also attenuated the reductions in fasting glucose, ET-1, and TNF-α compared with LoEx + PL and HiEx + PL (P &amp;amp;lt; .05).
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Met blunts exercise training-mediated increases in vascular insulin sensitivity at the levels of conduit arteries and capillaries, in parallel with altered inflammation and glycemic benefits.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    Objective
                    This study examined the impact of a 2‐week eucaloric diet high in ultraprocessed foods (UPF) compared to a diet without UPF (non‐UPF) on ad libitum energy intake (EI) and food selection in individuals aged 18–25.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In a randomized, crossover, proof‐of‐concept trial, participants completed two 14‐day controlled feeding periods (81% UPF vs. 0% UPF), with a 4‐week washout. Diets were matched for macronutrients, fiber, added sugar, diet quality, and energy density. Following each condition, participants consumed an ad libitum buffet meal including UPF and non‐UPF. Energy and food grams consumed were quantified. Statistical analyses were conducted for the full sample, late adolescents (aged 18–21), and young adults (aged 22–25).
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Twenty‐seven individuals aged 22 ± 2 years (mean BMI = 24 ± 3 kg/m
                      2
                      ) were included. Diet compliance was ~99% overall. There was no effect of diet condition on meal total kcal or grams consumed or UPF or non‐UPF consumption in the full sample (all
                      p
                       &amp;gt; 0.05). In the exploratory age subgroup analysis, an interaction between diet and age was observed for total EI (
                      p
                       &amp;lt; 0.001), where total EI increased among adolescents following the UPF diet (
                      p
                       = 0.03,
                      d
                       = 0.79), but not in young adults.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Late adolescents may be susceptible to increased EI following a UPF diet. Future trials are warranted to evaluate this possibility.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    In the past, fingernail and toenail analyses were mainly used for toxicological investigations on heavy metals and only a few studies used mineral content as a biomarker for assessing lifestyle or dietary habits. The Fulda NutriNAIL study examined associations between lifestyle, dietary habits, supplement use, and fingernail mineral composition in 184 participants (18–81 years) from Fulda, Germany. Mineral concentrations were quantified via Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP‐MS), and questionnaire data were analyzed for lifestyle correlations. Positive mineral‐to‐mineral correlations were observed between sodium (Na) and potassium (K) (
                    r
                     = 0.89), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) (
                    r
                     = 0.57), and iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) (
                    r
                     = 0.66). We detected 21% higher selenium levels in the fingernails of selenium supplement users than for non‐users. Omnivores showed higher Se levels than vegans and slightly higher levels than vegetarians and participants with thyroid disorders had significantly higher nail selenium levels. In addition, nail surface features were linked to specific mineral differences: potassium in brittle nails, reduced sodium and potassium in longitudinal ridges, and reduced chromium (Cr) in white spots. These findings demonstrate that fingernail mineral profiling is a non‐invasive method for assessing lifestyle‐ and diet‐related micronutrient status.
