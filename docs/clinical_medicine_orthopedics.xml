Abstract: 
                    Aims
                    Osteoporotic vertebral fractures substantially contribute to disability and often require surgical intervention. However, some challenges, such as implant failure and suboptimal bone regeneration, limit current treatments. Adipose-derived stem cells are promising for regenerative therapy because they are easily obtained, highly proliferative, and resistant to osteoporosis-related symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effects of osteogenic adipose-derived stem cell spheroids and β-tricalcium phosphate on vertebral bone regeneration in a rat osteoporotic vertebral fracture model.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    Osteoporosis was induced in 33 rats (11 per group) by ovariectomy, and defects were created in the L4 and L5 vertebrae. Adipose-derived stem cells were spheroidized and mixed with β-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds. Groups included osteogenic spheroids, undifferentiated spheroids, and β-tricalcium phosphate alone. Bone regeneration was assessed using micro-CT, histology, and biomechanical testing at four and eight weeks. Further in vitro analyses were conducted.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      The osteogenic spheroid group showed significantly higher bone mass, fusion score, and mechanical strength than the control group did. Histological analysis revealed enhanced new bone formation and β-tricalcium phosphate integration. Gene expression analysis revealed osteogenic marker (alkaline phosphatase (
                      ALP
                      ), osteocalcin (
                      OCN
                      ), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (
                      Runx2
                      )) and regenerative factor (bone morphogenetic protein 7 (
                      BMP-7
                      ), insulin-like growth factor 1 (
                      IGF-1
                      ), hepatocyte growth factor
                      1
                      (
                      HGF-1
                      ), and octamer-binding transcription factor
                      4
                      (
                      Oct4
                      ) upregulation, along with reduced apoptosis. Further, adipose-derived stem cell survival was confirmed at the repair site. These results indicate that adipose-derived stem cells contribute to both paracrine and direct osteogenesis.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Combining osteogenic adipose-derived stem cell spheroids with β-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds effectively promotes vertebral bone regeneration in osteoporotic vertebral fracture. This approach is a promising strategy for improving osteoporotic fracture repair with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    Previous observations of multi‐echo ultrashort echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) decay data from the Achilles tendon (AT) report an off‐resonance non‐water signal associated with non‐collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. This cross‐sectional study investigates the relationship between this MRI‐derived tissue matrix signal and mechanical stiffness of the AT in professional ballet dancers and non‐dancer adults. Multiexponential analysis of multi‐echo UTE MRI was used to quantify water components and an off‐resonance AT matrix component. To compare AT structure with its functionality, shear wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound US was used to measure tendon stiffness along both longitudinal (V
                    L
                    ) and transverse (V
                    S
                    ) axes. 34 participants, including 15 ballet dancers and 19 non‐dancers, were studied. Dancers exhibited significantly larger V
                    S
                    (
                    p
                     = 0.013) compared to non‐dancers, consistent with prior observations of a training effect in tendon from repeated loading with exercise. UTE‐derived off‐resonance relaxation component amplitude, β
                    3
                    , was positively associated with V
                    L
                    in dancers (
                    p
                     = 0.029) and V
                    S
                    in non‐dancers (
                    p
                     = 0.024), suggesting a microstructural role of this matrix component. While additional work is needed to unambiguously assign this off‐resonance signal, these findings suggest its association with non‐collagenous ECM and show potential for combined use of UTE and SWE imaging to assess tendon structure‐function relationships and adaptations to mechanical loading in vivo.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Importance
                    New care models promoting early access to physical therapy by reducing or eliminating co-pays are emerging. Few studies have compared health care use in these programs to other care pathways across musculoskeletal conditions.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    The objective of this study was to describe episode-level musculoskeletal health care use across different care pathway options, including a no-copay physical therapy program.
                  
                  
                    Design
                    This study was a descriptive retrospective analysis of claims data.
                  
                  
                    Setting and Participants
                    This study included health care beneficiaries of a self-insured employer with approximately 52,000 covered lives.
                  
                  
                    Interventions or Exposures
                    The study included musculoskeletal care episodes from October 2019 to September 2020 categorized as no copay physical therapy, traditional physical therapy, or other management.
                  
                  
                    Main Outcomes
                    Rates of surgery/injection, imaging, inpatient services, physician services, emergency services, physical therapy, and other services by episode type, overall and stratified by body region: upper extremity, lower extremity, and spine.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Of 9696 total episodes, 886 (9.1%) were no copay physical therapy, 1261 (13%) were traditional physical therapy, and 7549 (77.9%) were other management. No copay physical therapy episodes had lower imaging rates (38%) compared to traditional physical therapy (47%) and other management (45%) episodes. Inpatient services were similar for no copay (16%) and traditional (12%) physical therapy, both lower than other management episodes (23%). Physician services were higher in other management (100%) and traditional physical therapy (81%) episodes compared to no copay physical therapy episodes (43%). Surgery/injection rates were similar for no copay (11%) and traditional (8%) physical therapy, both lower than other management episodes (27%). Differences by pathway were more pronounced for extremity conditions than for spine conditions.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Rates of no copay program use were modest with those who used the program having lower rates of advanced imaging, injection, and surgery.
                  
                  
                    Relevance
                    Findings may be most relevant for employers, health systems, and payors planning resource allocation and benefit design for similar programs.
