Abstract: 
                    Study Design
                    Retrospective cohort study.
                  
                  
                    Objectives
                    Prior studies have shown that adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients undergoing revision surgery due to mechanical complications had less radiographic improvement and worsening patient-reported outcomes scores. The combination of customized 3D planning and personalized implants has been shown to contribute to improved achievement of alignment goals. This study aimed to determine whether such improved correction also results in a correspondingly lower revision surgery rate due to mechanical complications.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    Pre- and postoperative radiographic alignment measures, including lumbar lordosis (LL), distal lumbar lordosis (DLL), pelvic incidence (PI) – LL mismatch, and L1 pelvic angle (L1PA), as well as data on mechanical complications leading to reoperation were collected on 115 ASD patients with personalized interbody implants and minimum 2-year follow-up. This cohort was statistically compared to a multicenter dataset (ISSG) of 997 ASD patients treated using stock devices and using the same reoperation classifications.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Postoperatively achieved alignment measures correlated significantly with their respective preoperative alignment goals, with the following average offsets from plan: 2.4° LL, −0.2° DLL, −2.4° PI-LL, 0.3° L1PA. Compared to the ISSG cohort that utilized stock interbody implants, the cohort utilizing 3D preoperative planning and personalized interbody implants resulted in significantly fewer revisions for mechanical complications up to 2 years postoperatively: 5/115 (4.3%) vs 166/997 (16.6%),
                      P
                      &amp;lt; 0.001.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    These findings suggest that achieving planned alignment targets with personalized interbody devices is associated with reduced revision surgery for mechanical complications, a result which may have positive implications for improved patient outcomes and reduced cost.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To systematically review, map, and appraise the existing prospective evidence on risk factors for, and preventive strategies against, the development of patellofemoral pain (PFP), and to identify key gaps.
                  DESIGN: Systematic Evidence and Gap Map (EGM).
                  LITERATURE SEARCH: Nine electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CENTRAL) were searched from inception to the end of March 2024.
                  STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Published prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the development of PFP in individuals without baseline PFP were included. Studies of other knee conditions, older adults (mean age &amp;gt;45), or retrospective designs were excluded.
                  DATA SYNTHESIS: Evidence was mapped across the following domains: sociodemographic, neurobiological, anthropometric, psychological, biomechanical, and behavioural.
                  RESULTS: From 57,897 identified records, 36 studies were included: 24 prospective observational studies and 12 RCTs. Most studies focused on biomechanical risk factors (n = 22), with limited exploration of psychological (n = 1), behavioural (n = 2), and neurobiological (n = 1) domains. Preventive interventions involved orthoses (n = 4), exercise (n = 3), bracing (n = 2), gait retraining (1), stretching (1), or running intensity/volume modification. Non-biomechanical strategies such as education or graded exposure were rarely tested. Risk of bias was low to moderate for most prospective observational studies and moderate to high for most RCTs.
                  CONCLUSION: This evidence and gap map reveals an over-reliance on biomechanical perspectives within the context of PFP risk factor research, with limited attention to psychosocial, behavioural, and load-related risk factors. Preventive trials are few, often low in quality, and narrowly focused. Addressing these evidence gaps is essential for developing effective, multifactorial prevention strategies for PFP.

Abstract: 
                    
                      
                        ➢ Neurological injury remains the most common reason for ligation following total hip arthroplasty.
                      
                      
                        ➢ The main risk factors for neurological injury following total hip arthroplasty are preexisting spinal pathology, revision surgery, complex hip anatomy, female sex, surgeon inexperience, and excessive limb lengthening.
                      
                      
                        ➢ Postoperative pelvic computed tomographic scans may be used to assess component positioning and identify any compressive hematomas. Magnetic resonance imaging with a metal artifact reduction protocol may be used to evaluate architectural changes in the affected nerve.
                      
                      
                        ➢ Electromyography and nerve conduction studies may help to assess the level and grade of the nerve injury. These tests are most useful when performed in patients who show no signs of neurological improvement 3 to 6 weeks after surgery.
                      
                      
                        ➢ The mainstay of nonoperative management is supportive care with physical therapy, an ankle-foot orthosis, and neuropathic pain treatment.
                      
                      
                        ➢ The prognosis for a femoral nerve injury is generally more favorable than that for a sciatic nerve injury following total hip arthroplasty.
