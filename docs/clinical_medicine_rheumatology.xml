Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    The multinational, phase 3, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled TULIP‐SC trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous anifrolumab in adults who have moderate‐to‐severe SLE activity, despite receiving standard therapy.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    Adults with SLE received subcutaneous anifrolumab 120 mg or placebo once weekly for 52 weeks (1:1 randomization). Only the primary endpoint (treatment difference in BILAG‐based Composite Lupus Assessment [BICLA] response at 52 weeks) was formally tested in a pre‐planned interim analysis; key secondary and other endpoints were tested in the full analysis.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      At the interim analysis (220 patients, anifrolumab: n=109; placebo: n=111), the primary endpoint was met (anifrolumab vs placebo: 59.4% vs 43.9%; BICLA response difference [95% confidence interval]=15.5% [2.3–28.6%],
                      p
                      =0.0211).
                    
                    
                      The full analysis included 367 patients (anifrolumab: n=184; placebo: n=183). Versus placebo, more patients treated with anifrolumab attained a BICLA response whilst maintaining low/reduced oral glucocorticoid doses through Week 52 (56.2% vs 34.0%; difference=22.3% [12.3−32.2]
                      p
                      &amp;lt;0.0001), and the time to first sustained BICLA response was reduced (Hazard ratio=2.2 [1.5−3.2];
                      p
                      &amp;lt;0.0001). Treatment differences in Week 52 DORIS remission and Low Lupus Disease Activity State attainment rates favored anifrolumab over placebo (14.2% [5.6−22.8%],
                      p
                      =0.0012, and 14.1% [4.6−23.6%],
                      p
                      =0.0038). The frequencies of serious adverse events were 11.9% with anifrolumab and 10.4% with placebo; the frequencies of herpes zoster were 3.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Consistent with the well‐established profile of intravenous anifrolumab, subcutaneous anifrolumab demonstrated significant, clinically meaningful treatment benefits when added to standard therapy, and an acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate to severe SLE.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Objectives
                    This study aimed to estimate the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate the risks associated with immunosuppressant use—including hydroxychloroquine and teratogenic agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide—across specific APO categories.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    A cohort study was conducted using the 2005–2018 National Health Information Database of the National Health Insurance Service in Korea, involving 4,880 pregnancies in 3,059 women with SLE. The incidences of preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm birth, spontaneous abortion and stillbirth were estimated. Associations between APOs and medication patterns from preconception through pregnancy were analysed using univariate and multivariable models.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    The overall APO incidence among pregnant women with SLE was 45.0% (95% CI: 43.4, 46.5%). Compared with continuous hydroxychloroquine use, non-use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.85), discontinuation (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.61, 2.95), and initiation during pregnancy (AOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.16, 4.06) were significantly associated with increased preterm birth risk. Exposure to teratogenic immunosuppressants within 3 months of preconception or during the first trimester was associated with increased spontaneous abortion risk (AOR: 2.59 and 3.18, respectively).
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Continuity of hydroxychloroquine use from preconception through pregnancy reduces preterm birth risk in SLE. Conversely, early exposure to teratogenic immunosuppressants heightens the risk of spontaneous abortion. These findings underscore the importance of preconception medication planning in women with SLE.

Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    Cardiovascular events are major determinants of morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in patients with renal involvement. Although oxidative stress has been implicated in driving vascular and renal damage in SLE, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the potential role of oxidative stress‐induced alterations in fibrinogen structure and function in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis in SLE.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In this cross‐sectional study, we enrolled 144 adult patients with SLE and 90 matched controls. We measured blood leukocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, systemic redox status, and the structural and functional features of purified fibrinogen. Correlations between these parameters and disease activity were also investigated. In vitro experiments to clarify the causal relationships among ROS levels, protein oxidation, and fibrin abnormalities provided mechanistic insights of the observed alterations.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Patients with SLE showed increased leukocyte ROS production, mainly due to neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation. Interestingly, renal biopsies from patients with SLE with active proliferative lupus nephritis exhibited overexpression of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex p22phox. This was accompanied by plasma oxidative stress as indicated by elevated plasma lipid peroxidation and reduced antioxidant defenses. Fibrinogen oxidation was associated with structural and functional changes, leading to the formation of denser fibrin networks with lower clot porosity and reduced susceptibility to plasmin‐mediated fibrin lysis. Interestingly, these fibrinogen modifications correlated with alterations in redox status and disease activity.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Oxidative stress may drive structural and functional modifications of fibrinogen in SLE, potentially acting as a novel pathogenetic mechanism in atherothrombosis among these patients.

Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    This study aimed to investigate the relationship between a previously purpose‐developed lifestyle behavior scale and health care cost savings related to low back pain (LBP).
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    This longitudinal study used data from the Australian Twin Back (AUTBACK) study. LBP and lifestyle behavior measures were collected at baseline. Physical activity (PA) was objectively quantified via an accelerometer. A lifestyle behavior scale was created using variables of body mass index, PA, smoking status, and sleep quality. Weekly health care use for LBP was collected over one year. Health care costs were calculated by aggregating expenses for health care visits and medications, encompassing personal and Australia Medicare costs, and analyzed by two‐part models.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Individuals with lower lifestyle behavior scores, women, and those with a baseline episode of LBP were more likely to incur health care use costs (n = 307). A total of 2.6% of participants accounted for over 56% of the total expenditures. A one‐point improvement in the lifestyle behavior scale was significantly associated with 23% decrease in overall health care costs for LBP (95% confidence interval [CI] 7%−36%;
                      P
                      = 0.006), 25% decrease in medication costs for LBP (95% CI 13%−35%;
                      P
                      &amp;lt; 0.001), and 27% decrease in health care visit costs for LBP (95% CI 14%−39%;
                      P
                      &amp;lt; 0.001). The predicted difference in yearly health care use costs between individuals with the lowest and highest lifestyle scores was AU$873.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    This study demonstrated the association between greater adherence to positive lifestyle behaviors and reduced health care costs related to LBP. Interventions aimed at improving lifestyle behaviors could yield substantial cost savings for individuals and the health care system, mitigating the burden of LBP.
