Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    The multinational, phase 3, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled TULIP‐SC trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous anifrolumab in adults who have moderate‐to‐severe SLE activity, despite receiving standard therapy.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    Adults with SLE received subcutaneous anifrolumab 120 mg or placebo once weekly for 52 weeks (1:1 randomization). Only the primary endpoint (treatment difference in BILAG‐based Composite Lupus Assessment [BICLA] response at 52 weeks) was formally tested in a pre‐planned interim analysis; key secondary and other endpoints were tested in the full analysis.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      At the interim analysis (220 patients, anifrolumab: n=109; placebo: n=111), the primary endpoint was met (anifrolumab vs placebo: 59.4% vs 43.9%; BICLA response difference [95% confidence interval]=15.5% [2.3–28.6%],
                      p
                      =0.0211).
                    
                    
                      The full analysis included 367 patients (anifrolumab: n=184; placebo: n=183). Versus placebo, more patients treated with anifrolumab attained a BICLA response whilst maintaining low/reduced oral glucocorticoid doses through Week 52 (56.2% vs 34.0%; difference=22.3% [12.3−32.2]
                      p
                      &amp;lt;0.0001), and the time to first sustained BICLA response was reduced (Hazard ratio=2.2 [1.5−3.2];
                      p
                      &amp;lt;0.0001). Treatment differences in Week 52 DORIS remission and Low Lupus Disease Activity State attainment rates favored anifrolumab over placebo (14.2% [5.6−22.8%],
                      p
                      =0.0012, and 14.1% [4.6−23.6%],
                      p
                      =0.0038). The frequencies of serious adverse events were 11.9% with anifrolumab and 10.4% with placebo; the frequencies of herpes zoster were 3.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Consistent with the well‐established profile of intravenous anifrolumab, subcutaneous anifrolumab demonstrated significant, clinically meaningful treatment benefits when added to standard therapy, and an acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate to severe SLE.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Objectives
                    This study aimed to estimate the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate the risks associated with immunosuppressant use—including hydroxychloroquine and teratogenic agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide—across specific APO categories.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    A cohort study was conducted using the 2005–2018 National Health Information Database of the National Health Insurance Service in Korea, involving 4,880 pregnancies in 3,059 women with SLE. The incidences of preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm birth, spontaneous abortion and stillbirth were estimated. Associations between APOs and medication patterns from preconception through pregnancy were analysed using univariate and multivariable models.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    The overall APO incidence among pregnant women with SLE was 45.0% (95% CI: 43.4, 46.5%). Compared with continuous hydroxychloroquine use, non-use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.85), discontinuation (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.61, 2.95), and initiation during pregnancy (AOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.16, 4.06) were significantly associated with increased preterm birth risk. Exposure to teratogenic immunosuppressants within 3 months of preconception or during the first trimester was associated with increased spontaneous abortion risk (AOR: 2.59 and 3.18, respectively).
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Continuity of hydroxychloroquine use from preconception through pregnancy reduces preterm birth risk in SLE. Conversely, early exposure to teratogenic immunosuppressants heightens the risk of spontaneous abortion. These findings underscore the importance of preconception medication planning in women with SLE.

Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    The aim of this study was to compare differences in clinical response, drug survival, and adverse event rates between anakinra and canakinumab in VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X‐linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    This multicenter international study includes patients with VEXAS from France, Israel, and Italy treated with interleukin‐1 inhibition. Global response (GR) was defined as the absence of inflammatory symptoms and ≥50% decrease in steroid dose and C‐reactive protein. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify associated variables. Drug survival was analyzed using Kaplan‐Meier plots and log‐rank test, with Cox regression models for associated factors.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      We included 47 male patients with VEXAS; 44 received anakinra and 9 received canakinumab, with 6 patients using both at different time points. GR at 1 month was 34% for anakinra and 100% for canakinumab (
                      P
                      &amp;lt; 0.001) and 22% and 78% at 3 months, respectively (
                      P
                      = 0.001). Treatment with canakinumab was associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of achieving GR at 3 months (OR 28.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0–273.9;
                      P
                      = 0.004) in a multivariable analysis. Median drug survival was 54 (interquartile range [IQR] 30–56) months for canakinumab at 300 mg/month compared with 7 (IQR 4–8) months for canakinumab 150 mg/month and 1 (IQR 1–2.5) months for anakinra (
                      P
                      = 0.01). Injection‐site reactions were only recorded for the anakinra group (47 vs 0%;
                      P
                      = 0.006), whereas infections were more frequent in the anakinra group (31% and 11%;
                      P
                      = 0.3).
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Canakinumab demonstrated superior clinical response and drug survival with fewer adverse events compared with anakinra. Monthly canakinumab 300 mg may be considered as an effective steroid‐sparing therapeutic option for patients with VEXAS.

Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    Cardiovascular events are major determinants of morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in patients with renal involvement. Although oxidative stress has been implicated in driving vascular and renal damage in SLE, the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the potential role of oxidative stress‐induced alterations in fibrinogen structure and function in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis in SLE.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In this cross‐sectional study, we enrolled 144 adult patients with SLE and 90 matched controls. We measured blood leukocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, systemic redox status, and the structural and functional features of purified fibrinogen. Correlations between these parameters and disease activity were also investigated. In vitro experiments to clarify the causal relationships among ROS levels, protein oxidation, and fibrin abnormalities provided mechanistic insights of the observed alterations.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Patients with SLE showed increased leukocyte ROS production, mainly due to neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation. Interestingly, renal biopsies from patients with SLE with active proliferative lupus nephritis exhibited overexpression of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex p22phox. This was accompanied by plasma oxidative stress as indicated by elevated plasma lipid peroxidation and reduced antioxidant defenses. Fibrinogen oxidation was associated with structural and functional changes, leading to the formation of denser fibrin networks with lower clot porosity and reduced susceptibility to plasmin‐mediated fibrin lysis. Interestingly, these fibrinogen modifications correlated with alterations in redox status and disease activity.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Oxidative stress may drive structural and functional modifications of fibrinogen in SLE, potentially acting as a novel pathogenetic mechanism in atherothrombosis among these patients.

Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    There are no US Food and Drug Administration–approved therapies for Raynaud phenomenon (RP) in the United States. Clinical trials have been challenged by study design. Important advances in RP patient‐reported outcome measures and mechanistic quantification allow RP‐related pain characterization. The rationale for this narrative review is current RP treatment guidelines that focus on vasodilation.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    The question of why there are limitations to RP treatment in the United States is addressed through a comprehensive search strategy of published RP treatment guidelines up until September 1, 2025. Search databases included Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Scopus for the index terms “Raynaud's phenomenon treatment guidelines.” If a society guideline was updated, only the most recent was included. Eligibility, data extraction, risk of bias, and quality assessment were subject to review by two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving discrepancies. US‐specific considerations of published guidelines are reviewed.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    A total of 118 published articles were identified by the search terms “Raynaud's phenomenon treatment guidelines,” and 27 abstracts were reviewed. Four articles published as RP treatment recommendations or guidelines were reviewed for full content. Pain management for RP is not included in guideline‐based care.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    There are advances in outcome measures for quantifying pain now available for RP clinical trials. Large US‐based registries for systemic sclerosis using patient‐reported outcomes can allow serial data collection on RP and RP‐related digital lesions to provide real‐world data on medication efficacy for pain relief.
