Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    Objective
                    This study examined the impact of a 2‐week eucaloric diet high in ultraprocessed foods (UPF) compared to a diet without UPF (non‐UPF) on ad libitum energy intake (EI) and food selection in individuals aged 18–25.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In a randomized, crossover, proof‐of‐concept trial, participants completed two 14‐day controlled feeding periods (81% UPF vs. 0% UPF), with a 4‐week washout. Diets were matched for macronutrients, fiber, added sugar, diet quality, and energy density. Following each condition, participants consumed an ad libitum buffet meal including UPF and non‐UPF. Energy and food grams consumed were quantified. Statistical analyses were conducted for the full sample, late adolescents (aged 18–21), and young adults (aged 22–25).
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Twenty‐seven individuals aged 22 ± 2 years (mean BMI = 24 ± 3 kg/m
                      2
                      ) were included. Diet compliance was ~99% overall. There was no effect of diet condition on meal total kcal or grams consumed or UPF or non‐UPF consumption in the full sample (all
                      p
                       &amp;gt; 0.05). In the exploratory age subgroup analysis, an interaction between diet and age was observed for total EI (
                      p
                       &amp;lt; 0.001), where total EI increased among adolescents following the UPF diet (
                      p
                       = 0.03,
                      d
                       = 0.79), but not in young adults.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Late adolescents may be susceptible to increased EI following a UPF diet. Future trials are warranted to evaluate this possibility.

Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    The plant-based diet index (PDI) has been proposed as a gauge of diet healthfulness. This study assessed the relationship between the PDI, and the “healthful” hPDI and “unhealthful” uPDI, and weight loss in the context of Mediterranean and vegan diets in overweight adults.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    In a cross-over trial, 62 overweight adults followed a Mediterranean and a low-fat vegan diet for 16 weeks in random order, separated by a 4-week washout. Body weight was the primary outcome. In a secondary analysis, three-day dietary records were analyzed, PDI indices were calculated. Their correlation with changes in body weight was assessed, using Spearman correlations.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet, PDI significantly increased on the vegan diet; effect size: +7.6 (95% CI +4.1 to +11.0);
                      p
                       &amp;amp;lt; 0.001. The hPDI score increased on both diets; effect size: +3.8 (95% CI −0.0 to +7.6);
                      p
                       = 0.05. The uPDI score decreased on the Mediterranean diet, while it increased on the vegan diet; effect size: +11.9 (95% CI +8.9 to +14.8);
                      p
                       &amp;amp;lt; 0.001. In the first 16 weeks of the study, across both diets, changes in PDI and uPDI were negatively associated with changes in body weight, i.e., increases in PDI and uPDI were associated with weight loss:
                      r
                       = −0.32;
                      p
                       = 0.01; and
                      r
                       = −0.47;
                      p
                       &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, respectively. These associations remained significant even after adjustment for changes in energy intake. No association was observed between changes in hPDI and changes in body weight.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    These findings suggest that, replacing animal products even with the “unhealthful” plant-based foods on a vegan diet was associated with weight loss.

Abstract: 
                    Background
                    Consumer food choices are changing towards a more plant-based diet (PBD) due to growing awareness of their less detrimental effects on health and the environment. However, PBDs—particularly vegan diets—may lead to nutritional deficiencies compared to non-PBDs. These differences may, in part, be influenced by the typically lower caloric content of PBDs.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    To compare the nutritional adequacy and environmental footprints of four 7-day menu models (~ 2,000 kcal/day) Mediterranean (omnivorous) diet, two vegetarian-like diets, and one vegan.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    Menus were designed based on the recommendations of the Spanish Society for Community Nutrition (SENC) and Vegetarian Union (UVE), substituting animal-based foods with plant-based alternatives. Nutritional intake was assessed using the Spanish BEDCA food composition table (Base de Datos Española de Composición de Alimentos) and adequacy was evaluated using Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) and recommended intake levels. Daily environmental footprints were estimated with Agribalyse. Differences between the four diet models were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by post-hoc analyses to identify pairwise differences in nutrient intake (significance level: 95%).
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Daily macronutrient intake did not differ substantially across the diet groups. Furthermore, all four menus met protein needs and most micronutrient DRIs. Shortfalls were observed for vitamin D and iodine across all diets, and for vitamin B₁₂ in the vegan model;
                      ω
                      -3 PUFA were below the 250 mg/day target in all diets, while saturated fat remained &amp;amp;lt; 8% of total energy intake. Mean daily environmental footprints decreased progressively from omnivorous to vegan diets: −46% CO₂, −6.6% deprived water and −33% land use among others.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Well-planned PBDs can achieve comparable sustainability and nutritional adequacy to a healthy Mediterranean diet, although attention is required to ensure adequate intake of certain micronutrients.
