Abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, allergic, immune-mediated inflammation of the esophagus caused by food antigens. The prevalence in pediatric population is approximately 34 to 57 cases per 100,000 children, with a male to female ration 3:1. This number may be underestimated due to diagnostic challenges and variety of clinical presentations in different age groups. Diagnosis of EoE requires histopathological assessment of esophageal biopsies retrieved during gastroscopy, with at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field (HPF) in the esophageal tissue being the cut off value. According to recommendations, treatment options of EoE include dietary interventions (elimination diets), medical treatment (inhibitors of proton pump, steroids, biologics), and in some cases surgical intervention (dilation). Dietary intervention, such as elimination diets, target the triggering factors of the disease and, if supervised by professional nutritionist, have the least systemic side effects. On the other hand, depending on the number of allergens eliminated from the pediatric patients’ diet, the quality of life both of the child and their caretakers may be compromised. Additional challenges such as nutritional risks, feeding disorders, financial burden, and social life impairment also have to be taken into consideration. On top of this, an effectiveness assessment of chosen therapy requires repeated endoscopic examination with several biopsies of the esophagus, further increasing diseases burden in EoE patients. Taking all of this factors into consideration, the main objective of this narrative review was to address challenges that pediatric patients with EoE on dietary treatment face with reference to current research and daily practice.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a critical public health issue, particularly in New Zealand, where prevalence rates are high, especially among Māori and Pacific people. Recent research indicates that dietary interventions, particularly carbohydrate reduction, can lead to the remission or reversal of T2D. However, little is known about how such approaches perform when implemented in routine New Zealand primary care, particularly within high-risk and underserved populations. This study aimed to evaluate changes in HbA1c, diabetes status, and cardiometabolic outcomes among adults with prediabetes and T2D engaged in such a model of care. Methods: This study reports findings from a retrospective, observational, real-world, multi-site clinical audit (service evaluation) of a holistic model of care implemented in three primary care practices in New Zealand. The model of care is characterised by a three-pronged approach: whole food, carbohydrate reduction; a health-coach, behaviour-change-based delivery approach; and community- or peer-based initiatives. Audit data from 106 patients with prediabetes (PD) and T2D were analysed (median follow-up 19 months; IQR 6–32) to assess changes in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, diabetes status, and cardiometabolic outcomes. Results: We observed an overall reduction in HbA1c (median change −3 mmol/mol (IQR: −7 to 3), p = 0.004), with 32% of patients with T2D at baseline achieving reversal and 44% of those with PD attaining normoglycaemia at final follow-up. Weight loss was associated with greater HbA1c reduction (0.56 mmol/mol decrease per kg lost) and additional improvements seen in lowered alanine aminotransferase (ALT). HDL cholesterol showed a small decline (r = 0.31), and triglycerides and blood pressure showed no significant change, indicating that these measures remained broadly stable over the evaluation period. Conclusions: Given the retrospective and uncontrolled audit design, findings should be interpreted with appropriate caution. However, the consistent improvements observed across multiple practices suggest that carbohydrate-reduction strategies within holistic models of care can meaningfully improve diabetes outcomes in real-world primary care settings. Future research should evaluate longer-term sustainability, implementation fidelity, and the applicability of this model at scale, particularly for Māori and Pacific communities.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Infertility is a multifactorial condition with an etiopathology that remains largely unclear. Although substantial evidence implicates oxidative stress (OS) as a key contributor to both male and female infertility, targeted strategies for OS-mediated reproductive dysfunction are still not well defined and require further investigation. Ubiquinol is the reduced form of Coenzyme Q10 involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics. It can be synthesized by humans endogenously or provided by dietary sources—typically egg yolks, oily fish, organ meats, and in smaller amounts in nuts and seeds and leafy green vegetables. The present article reviews possible mechanisms through which Ubiquinol plays a role in the regulation of fertility and reproduction, discussing why it could be positioned as a conditionally essential nutrient. Several questions and areas for further inquiry are also proposed. Methods: The present position paper narratively summarizes evidence related to Ubiquinol fertility and reproduction, focusing on the literature from PubMed, Science Direct, and Semantic Scholar. Results: Research advancements suggest that when physiological demands rise during certain life stages, e.g., the reproductive years, the amount of Ubiquinol produced internally may not be enough to meet heightened needs, particularly with advanced maternal/paternal age. This places a heavier reliance on obtaining Ubiquinol from the diet, thus presenting itself as a conditionally essential nutrient during certain life stages. Conclusions: Overall, Ubiquinol appears to enhance mitochondrial energy production and antioxidant defense in gametes, a process that appears to aid sperm function, oocyte quality, and early embryo development. Collectively, these data indicate a key physiological role for Ubiquinol in male and female fertility, especially given its age-related decline.
