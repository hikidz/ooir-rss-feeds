Abstract: 
            Background:
            Ketamine is increasingly used in the United Kingdom in non-clinical settings for its psychoactive effects, with rising reports of harms including hospital admissions, dependence and deaths. In light of current debates surrounding the reclassification of ketamine under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, up-to-date surveillance of associated mortality is warranted.
          
          
            Aims:
            We aimed to quantify trends in deaths following illicit ketamine use in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and to examine changes in demographic and contextual characteristics since the last national analysis which comprised illicit ketamine deaths up to 2019.
          
          
            Methods:
            Cases where illicit ketamine was detected at post-mortem were extracted from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality and analysed.
          
          
            Results:
            There were 696 deaths identified with illicit ketamine between 1999 and 2024. Annual deaths increased over 10-fold from 2014 (15 deaths) to 2024 (197 projected deaths). Whilst absolute deaths implicating illicit ketamine rose (2014: 6 deaths; 2023: 123 projected deaths), the proportion of deaths where illicit ketamine was implicated in causing death declined (2014: 60.0% of cases; 2024: 42.6% of cases). Concurrently, polydrug use increased (median number of co-administered substances 1999–2004: 3; 2005–2009: 3, 2010–2014: 4, 2015–2019: 6; 2020–2024: 6), and the demographic profile of decedents shifted towards greater deprivation and dependence-related contexts.
          
          
            Discussion and Conclusions:
            There has been an acceleration in deaths following illicit ketamine in recent years, which are increasingly featuring complex patterns of polydrug use and socio-economic vulnerability. Policy responses must extend beyond single-substance legislative controls to encompass harm reduction, treatment integration, and social support strategies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
          
            
            
              Acoziborole is an oxaborole 6-carboxamide active against
              Trypanosoma brucei gambiense
              and
              rhodesiense
              , the parasites responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. This open-label, phase I study in six healthy male participants evaluated the mass balance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism pathways, and excretion of a single oral 960 mg dose of [
              14
              C]-acoziborole. Blood, plasma, and feces were collected for 120 days and urine for 16 days. The excretion balance and systemic exposure of total circulating radioactivity were determined using accelerator mass spectrometry. Metabolism profiling was performed in pools of plasma, urine, and feces. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry quantified acoziborole and its metabolite SCYX-3109 in plasma and urine. By Day 60, 87.3% of the total radioactivity had been recovered (10.9% and 74.2% of the total dose in urine and in feces, respectively), with an excretion increment of &amp;lt;1% between Days 59 and 61. Mean ratios of total radioactivity indicated an equivalent distribution between blood cells and plasma. The concentration-time profiles of total radioactivity and acoziborole in plasma were similar. In plasma, acoziborole accounted for 95.1%, an oxidized form of acoziborole for 2.3% of the total radioactivity, while SCYX-3109 was not detected. Seven metabolites (oxidative deboronation, glucuronidation, and mono-oxidation) were detected in urine with individual abundances relative to the dose of 0.1–2.1%; unchanged acoziborole accounted for 0.6%. In feces, acoziborole, SCYX-3109, and two other oxidized or deboronated forms of acoziborole represented 33.6%, 12.3%, and 2.3% of the dose, respectively. Acoziborole showed good absorption, limited metabolism, minimal urinary elimination, and predominant but slow biliary-fecal elimination.

Abstract: Background and PurposeThe functional organization of corneal cold nerve endings, critical structures in maintaining the ocular surface, remains poorly understood. Here, the photoisomerizable small‐molecule diethylamine‐azobenzene‐quaternary ammonium (DENAQ) was used to photomodulate activity of cold‐sensing nerve terminals in control and chronic tear‐deficient corneas. Furthermore, DENAQ was used for in vivo photochemical regulation of the thermally induced blink reflex.Experimental ApproachExtracellular nerve terminal impulse activity was recorded on cold terminals in excised corneas of naïve and tear‐deficient guinea pigs pre‐incubated with DENAQ. Pulses of light at a wavelength of 460 nm were delivered to the perfused corneas. The thermally induced blink reflex was assessed using orbicularis oculi electromyography in anaesthetised rats after topical administration of DENAQ to the eye under blue light and darkness conditions.Key ResultsExposure to blue light robustly reduced spontaneous activity of both naïve and tear‐deficient cold nerve terminals pre‐incubated with DENAQ, while cold‐evoked responses remained unaffected. Pre‐incubation of excised corneas with DENAQ, along with pharmacological P2X receptor antagonists, prevented the DENAQ‐mediated photoreduction of the cold nerve terminal spontaneous activity. In addition, blue light increased cold‐evoked reflex blink in eyes pre‐treated with DENAQ.Conclusion and ImplicationsDENAQ enters guinea pig cold sensory nerve endings primarily through P2X channels in excised corneas. Subsequently, DENAQ decreases the spontaneous nerve terminal impulse activity upon light irradiation by modulating voltage‐gated potassium (KV) channel activity. Furthermore, the cold‐evoked blink reflex is modulated by light in DENAQ‐treated eyes. Chemical photoswitches like DENAQ might be potential new treatments for ocular discomfort and pain in dry eye disease.

Abstract: Abstract
          Developmental epilepsy syndromes are characterized by recurrent seizures and developmental delays. Current anticonvulsants target γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor signaling to decrease neuronal excitability, however, there are adverse effects for the developing brain, and many patients are refractory. The major non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has emerged as an anti-seizure medication effective in select developmental epilepsy syndromes, but its overall applicability in treating seizure disorders is limited. In the present study, we characterize a small library of non-Cannabis carvone derived CBD (+) enantiomers, with the larger goal of identifying novel therapeutics for developmental epilepsy syndromes. EEG based structure activity relationship assessment supports that elongated alkyl chains increase the potency of the congeners, with (+)-CBD-oct displaying effects on both δ and θ frequency bands. Pre-treatment with (+)-CBD-oct promotes seizure resilience in both wildtype mice and the Gabra2-1 model of developmental epilepsy by influencing seizure characteristics, and reduces mortality. 5 days of (+)-CBD-oct oral gavage in wildtype and Gabra2-1 mice during postnatal development normalizes the aberrant dendritic spine phenotype of Gabra2-1 mice. These findings advance the development of novel anticonvulsants by validating an influence of alkyl chain length of synthetic CBD congeners.
