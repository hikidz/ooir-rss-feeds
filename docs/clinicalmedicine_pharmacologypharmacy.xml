Abstract: Abstract
          
            Purpose
            This study aims to evaluate the ability of various cyclodextrins (CDs) to enhance the aqueous solubility of haloperidol (HAL), through the formation of inclusion complexes. It also investigates the pharmacological activity of CD/HAL complexes using a planaria model.
          
          
            Methods
            Inclusion complexes were prepared using α-CD, β-CD, methyl-β-CD, hydroxypropyl-β-CD and γ-CD. The solubility of HAL in the presence of CDs was assessed, and the stoichiometry of the complexes was determined using Job’s method. Physicochemical interactions between HAL and CDs were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The in vivo pharmacological activity was tested in planaria worms following exposure to HAL in the presence or absence of CDs.
          
          
            Results
            HAL’s aqueous solubility was significantly enhanced in the presence of α-CD, methyl-β-CD, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD, while γ-CD showed no effect. Only modest solubility improvements were observed with increasing β-CD concentrations up to 8 mg/mL. Stoichiometric analysis confirmed a 1:1 ratio of HAL to CD in the inclusion complexes. In vivo studies demonstrated that HAL reduced planaria mobility, mimicking cataleptic effects seen in mammals, whereas the presence of CDs reduced this pharmacological effect.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Cyclodextrins, particularly α-CD, methyl-β-CD, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD, effectively enhance the solubility of haloperidol by forming 1:1 inclusion complexes. The reduction in haloperidol-induced behavioral changes in planaria by CDs suggests a potential impact on drug bioavailability and supports the use of planaria as a simple in vivo model for screening neuroactive compounds and formulations.

Abstract: 
            Background:
            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition for which there are few efficacious treatments. Psilocybin is being studied for use in treatment-resistant depression but has not yet been investigated in PTSD.
          
          
            Aims:
            The trial’s primary outcome was to investigate the safety and tolerability of single-dose psilocybin in participants with PTSD.
          
          
            Methods:
            This was a Phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter trial. Secondary outcomes were changes in PTSD symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5); PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)), functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale; SDS) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L index score).
          
          
            Results:
            
              Amongst the 22 participants enrolled (63.6% female; mean (SD) age, 39.0 (7.91) years), there was a total of 117 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); 70 (59.8%) were reported on administration day, of which 64/70 (91.4%) resolved by the end of the next day. TEAEs commonly included headache (
              n
               = 11; 50.0%), nausea (
              n
               = 8; 36.4%), crying (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%) and fatigue (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%). There were no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to study withdrawal. Pre-post comparisons indicated a clinically meaningful change from Baseline in mean CAPS-5 total score at Week 4 (−29.9 (14.06)) and Week 12 (−29.5 (15.43)), which was associated with the intensity of psychedelic experience on Day 1. PCL-5 scores showed symptom reduction was rapid and sustained until Week 12. SDS total score and EQ-5D-5L index score showed similar improvements.
            
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Psilocybin at a dose of 25 mg, administered with psychological support, may be safe, well-tolerated and associated with symptomatic improvement in adults with PTSD. Further investigation is warranted.

Abstract: Abstract
          Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), laser, and vitrectomy therapy are commonly used for the management of vision-threatening posterior eye disease (PED), but non-invasive alternatives have garnered increasing popularity as proactive preventative strategies for early retinopathy, such as targeted plant-based diets or herbal supplements. However, only some plants contain bioactive compounds that specifically target retinal degeneration and demonstrate potent pharmacological benefits that are cost-effective, safe, and accessible for at-risk individuals. This review pinpoints plant bioactive compounds, specifically polyphenols and carotenoids, that target retinopathy, with a focus on apoptotic, angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative pathways leading to visible, functional, and vascular macula improvements. Innovations accelerating therapeutic applications of these botanicals for ocular delivery were then explored. Finally, advancements in disease assessments and the computational methods for early retinopathy biomarker diagnosis and treatment, particularly designed to bio-prospect plant-based therapies, were also reviewed to guide future developments and address translational limitations.
