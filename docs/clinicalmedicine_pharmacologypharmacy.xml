Abstract: Abstract
          
            Purpose
            This study aims to evaluate the ability of various cyclodextrins (CDs) to enhance the aqueous solubility of haloperidol (HAL), through the formation of inclusion complexes. It also investigates the pharmacological activity of CD/HAL complexes using a planaria model.
          
          
            Methods
            Inclusion complexes were prepared using α-CD, β-CD, methyl-β-CD, hydroxypropyl-β-CD and γ-CD. The solubility of HAL in the presence of CDs was assessed, and the stoichiometry of the complexes was determined using Job’s method. Physicochemical interactions between HAL and CDs were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The in vivo pharmacological activity was tested in planaria worms following exposure to HAL in the presence or absence of CDs.
          
          
            Results
            HAL’s aqueous solubility was significantly enhanced in the presence of α-CD, methyl-β-CD, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD, while γ-CD showed no effect. Only modest solubility improvements were observed with increasing β-CD concentrations up to 8 mg/mL. Stoichiometric analysis confirmed a 1:1 ratio of HAL to CD in the inclusion complexes. In vivo studies demonstrated that HAL reduced planaria mobility, mimicking cataleptic effects seen in mammals, whereas the presence of CDs reduced this pharmacological effect.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Cyclodextrins, particularly α-CD, methyl-β-CD, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD, effectively enhance the solubility of haloperidol by forming 1:1 inclusion complexes. The reduction in haloperidol-induced behavioral changes in planaria by CDs suggests a potential impact on drug bioavailability and supports the use of planaria as a simple in vivo model for screening neuroactive compounds and formulations.

Abstract: 
            Background:
            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition for which there are few efficacious treatments. Psilocybin is being studied for use in treatment-resistant depression but has not yet been investigated in PTSD.
          
          
            Aims:
            The trial’s primary outcome was to investigate the safety and tolerability of single-dose psilocybin in participants with PTSD.
          
          
            Methods:
            This was a Phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter trial. Secondary outcomes were changes in PTSD symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5); PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)), functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale; SDS) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L index score).
          
          
            Results:
            
              Amongst the 22 participants enrolled (63.6% female; mean (SD) age, 39.0 (7.91) years), there was a total of 117 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); 70 (59.8%) were reported on administration day, of which 64/70 (91.4%) resolved by the end of the next day. TEAEs commonly included headache (
              n
               = 11; 50.0%), nausea (
              n
               = 8; 36.4%), crying (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%) and fatigue (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%). There were no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to study withdrawal. Pre-post comparisons indicated a clinically meaningful change from Baseline in mean CAPS-5 total score at Week 4 (−29.9 (14.06)) and Week 12 (−29.5 (15.43)), which was associated with the intensity of psychedelic experience on Day 1. PCL-5 scores showed symptom reduction was rapid and sustained until Week 12. SDS total score and EQ-5D-5L index score showed similar improvements.
            
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Psilocybin at a dose of 25 mg, administered with psychological support, may be safe, well-tolerated and associated with symptomatic improvement in adults with PTSD. Further investigation is warranted.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Rationale
            Between periods of use, chronic cannabis consumers may display residual effects on selective cognitive functions, particularly memory and attention. Whether there are comparable deficits in real-world behaviors, such as driving, has not been thoroughly examined.
          
          
            Objectives
            The current study explored the association between driving simulator performance, cannabis use history, and demographic factors after ≥ 48 h of abstinence. Study I examined simulator performance across a broad range of use within 191 healthy cannabis users. Study II compared performance between participants with the highest cannabis use intensity and a non-cannabis-using comparison group.
          
          
            Methods
            In Study I, 191 healthy cannabis users completed a 25-minute simulated drive, following ≥ 48 h of abstinence. In Study II, a pilot study comprising a subset of 18 frequent cannabis users was compared to 12 non-using controls who completed identical driving measures in a separate study. In both studies, the main outcome was the Composite Drive Score (CDS), a global measure of driving performance comprising key driving-related variables, including standard deviation of lateral position.
          
          
            Results
            In Study I, there was no relationship between CDS, its subtests, measures of cannabis use history, or demographic variables (all ps &amp;gt; 0.10). In Study II, frequent cannabis users and the non-using comparison group did not differ on CDS or performance on its subtests (all ps &amp;gt; 0.40).
          
          
            Conclusions
            The current study did not find evidence of a residual effect of cannabis on simulated driving performance during a short period of cannabis abstinence. Future studies would benefit from inclusion of larger non-cannabis-using comparison groups.
