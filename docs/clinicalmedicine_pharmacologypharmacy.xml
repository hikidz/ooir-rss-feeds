Abstract: 
            Background:
            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition for which there are few efficacious treatments. Psilocybin is being studied for use in treatment-resistant depression but has not yet been investigated in PTSD.
          
          
            Aims:
            The trial’s primary outcome was to investigate the safety and tolerability of single-dose psilocybin in participants with PTSD.
          
          
            Methods:
            This was a Phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter trial. Secondary outcomes were changes in PTSD symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5); PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)), functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale; SDS) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L index score).
          
          
            Results:
            
              Amongst the 22 participants enrolled (63.6% female; mean (SD) age, 39.0 (7.91) years), there was a total of 117 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); 70 (59.8%) were reported on administration day, of which 64/70 (91.4%) resolved by the end of the next day. TEAEs commonly included headache (
              n
               = 11; 50.0%), nausea (
              n
               = 8; 36.4%), crying (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%) and fatigue (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%). There were no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to study withdrawal. Pre-post comparisons indicated a clinically meaningful change from Baseline in mean CAPS-5 total score at Week 4 (−29.9 (14.06)) and Week 12 (−29.5 (15.43)), which was associated with the intensity of psychedelic experience on Day 1. PCL-5 scores showed symptom reduction was rapid and sustained until Week 12. SDS total score and EQ-5D-5L index score showed similar improvements.
            
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Psilocybin at a dose of 25 mg, administered with psychological support, may be safe, well-tolerated and associated with symptomatic improvement in adults with PTSD. Further investigation is warranted.

Abstract: Abstract
          Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), laser, and vitrectomy therapy are commonly used for the management of vision-threatening posterior eye disease (PED), but non-invasive alternatives have garnered increasing popularity as proactive preventative strategies for early retinopathy, such as targeted plant-based diets or herbal supplements. However, only some plants contain bioactive compounds that specifically target retinal degeneration and demonstrate potent pharmacological benefits that are cost-effective, safe, and accessible for at-risk individuals. This review pinpoints plant bioactive compounds, specifically polyphenols and carotenoids, that target retinopathy, with a focus on apoptotic, angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative pathways leading to visible, functional, and vascular macula improvements. Innovations accelerating therapeutic applications of these botanicals for ocular delivery were then explored. Finally, advancements in disease assessments and the computational methods for early retinopathy biomarker diagnosis and treatment, particularly designed to bio-prospect plant-based therapies, were also reviewed to guide future developments and address translational limitations.

Abstract: 
            Purpose/Background:
            Multiple meta-analyses have suggested that pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing may be a valuable tool to improve clinical outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have failed at least one treatment. However, these meta-analyses included studies with different PGx tests and different trial designs, which produce uncertainty when interpreting results. To investigate the clinical utility of a single weighted multigene PGx test, a meta-analysis was performed for prospective studies utilizing this PGx test in adult patients with MDD.
          
          
            Methods/Procedures:
            MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane [including Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)] were searched through May 2025 for studies evaluating the impact of pharmacogenomic testing on outcomes for patients with MDD. Using PRISMA guidelines, 243 records were identified, and 6 studies were included that compared PGx-guided care to unguided care in adult patients with MDD, using a single weighted multigene test.
          
          
            Findings/Results:
            Overall, 3,532 patients were included, with outcomes evaluated at week 8 or week 10. Patients with MDD whose care was guided by the weighted multigene PGx test were 30% more likely to achieve response [relative risk ratio (RR)=1.30, 95% CI: 1.16-1.47, P&amp;lt;0.001] and 41% more likely to achieve remission [RR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.19-1.66, P&amp;lt;0.001] compared to unguided care. No heterogeneity in outcomes across studies was detected.
          
          
            Implications/Conclusions:
            Prescribing informed by a weighted multigene PGx test significantly improved response and remission rates among adult patients with MDD who experienced at least 1 prior treatment failure, further demonstrating the clinical utility of weighted multigene PGx testing.
