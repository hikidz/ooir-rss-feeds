Abstract: 
            Background:
            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition for which there are few efficacious treatments. Psilocybin is being studied for use in treatment-resistant depression but has not yet been investigated in PTSD.
          
          
            Aims:
            The trial’s primary outcome was to investigate the safety and tolerability of single-dose psilocybin in participants with PTSD.
          
          
            Methods:
            This was a Phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter trial. Secondary outcomes were changes in PTSD symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5); PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)), functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale; SDS) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L index score).
          
          
            Results:
            
              Amongst the 22 participants enrolled (63.6% female; mean (SD) age, 39.0 (7.91) years), there was a total of 117 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); 70 (59.8%) were reported on administration day, of which 64/70 (91.4%) resolved by the end of the next day. TEAEs commonly included headache (
              n
               = 11; 50.0%), nausea (
              n
               = 8; 36.4%), crying (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%) and fatigue (
              n
               = 6; 27.3%). There were no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to study withdrawal. Pre-post comparisons indicated a clinically meaningful change from Baseline in mean CAPS-5 total score at Week 4 (−29.9 (14.06)) and Week 12 (−29.5 (15.43)), which was associated with the intensity of psychedelic experience on Day 1. PCL-5 scores showed symptom reduction was rapid and sustained until Week 12. SDS total score and EQ-5D-5L index score showed similar improvements.
            
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Psilocybin at a dose of 25 mg, administered with psychological support, may be safe, well-tolerated and associated with symptomatic improvement in adults with PTSD. Further investigation is warranted.

Abstract: Abstract
          Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), laser, and vitrectomy therapy are commonly used for the management of vision-threatening posterior eye disease (PED), but non-invasive alternatives have garnered increasing popularity as proactive preventative strategies for early retinopathy, such as targeted plant-based diets or herbal supplements. However, only some plants contain bioactive compounds that specifically target retinal degeneration and demonstrate potent pharmacological benefits that are cost-effective, safe, and accessible for at-risk individuals. This review pinpoints plant bioactive compounds, specifically polyphenols and carotenoids, that target retinopathy, with a focus on apoptotic, angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative pathways leading to visible, functional, and vascular macula improvements. Innovations accelerating therapeutic applications of these botanicals for ocular delivery were then explored. Finally, advancements in disease assessments and the computational methods for early retinopathy biomarker diagnosis and treatment, particularly designed to bio-prospect plant-based therapies, were also reviewed to guide future developments and address translational limitations.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Rationale
            Between periods of use, chronic cannabis consumers may display residual effects on selective cognitive functions, particularly memory and attention. Whether there are comparable deficits in real-world behaviors, such as driving, has not been thoroughly examined.
          
          
            Objectives
            The current study explored the association between driving simulator performance, cannabis use history, and demographic factors after ≥ 48 h of abstinence. Study I examined simulator performance across a broad range of use within 191 healthy cannabis users. Study II compared performance between participants with the highest cannabis use intensity and a non-cannabis-using comparison group.
          
          
            Methods
            In Study I, 191 healthy cannabis users completed a 25-minute simulated drive, following ≥ 48 h of abstinence. In Study II, a pilot study comprising a subset of 18 frequent cannabis users was compared to 12 non-using controls who completed identical driving measures in a separate study. In both studies, the main outcome was the Composite Drive Score (CDS), a global measure of driving performance comprising key driving-related variables, including standard deviation of lateral position.
          
          
            Results
            In Study I, there was no relationship between CDS, its subtests, measures of cannabis use history, or demographic variables (all ps &amp;gt; 0.10). In Study II, frequent cannabis users and the non-using comparison group did not differ on CDS or performance on its subtests (all ps &amp;gt; 0.40).
          
          
            Conclusions
            The current study did not find evidence of a residual effect of cannabis on simulated driving performance during a short period of cannabis abstinence. Future studies would benefit from inclusion of larger non-cannabis-using comparison groups.
