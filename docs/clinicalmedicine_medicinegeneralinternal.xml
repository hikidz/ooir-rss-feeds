Abstract: ImportanceEffective and well-tolerated pharmacotherapies for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, are needed.ObjectiveTo determine the dose-response relationship of MM120 (lysergide D-tartrate) in adults with moderate to severe GAD.Design, Settings, and ParticipantsThis phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 198 adults aged 18 to 74 years with a primary GAD diagnosis who presented with moderate to severe symptoms (defined by a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A] score ≥20) and was conducted at 22 outpatient psychiatric research sites in the US from August 2022 to August 2023. The anxiety and depression end point assessments were conducted by independent central raters who were blinded to the trial protocol, treatment allocation, and study visit date. The last date of follow-up was November 27, 2023.InterventionsParticipants were randomized to receive a single (freebase equivalent) treatment dose with 25 µg (n = 39), 50 µg (n = 40), 100 µg (n = 40), or 200 µg (n = 40) of MM120 or placebo (n = 39).Main Outcome and MeasuresThe primary outcome was a dose-response relationship assessed using the multiple comparison procedure modeling (MCP-Mod) method for change in HAM-A score at 4 weeks (score range, 0-56; higher scores indicate greater severity; ≤7 indicates no or minimal anxiety; 8-14, mild; 15-23, moderate; and ≥24, severe). The minimal clinically important difference was 2.5 points.ResultsOf the 198 participants randomized, 194 were included in the full analysis set (mean age, 41.3 [SD, 13.6] years; 56.7% were female; and 3.6% were Asian, 7.7% were Black or African American, and 83.0% were White). The dose-response relationship assessed using the MCP-Mod method for change in HAM-A score at week 4 was statistically significant for the 100-µg and the 200-µg dose groups vs placebo (least-squares mean difference, −5.0 points [95% CI, −9.6 to −0.4 points] with 100 µg of MM120 and −6.0 points [95% CI, −9.8 to −2.0 points] with 200 µg of MM120) but the 25-µg and 50-µg dose groups did not reach significance vs placebo (least-squares mean difference, −1.2 points [95% CI, −6.0 to 3.5 points] with 25 µg of MM120 and −1.8 points [95% CI, −7.6 to 4.0 points] with 50 µg of MM120). The adverse events were consistent with the expected effects of MM120. The most common adverse events were visual perceptual changes (illusion, pseudo-hallucination, and visual hallucination), which occurred in 46.2% of participants who received 25 µg of MM120, in 75.0% who received 50 µg, in 92.5% who received 100 µg, in 100% who received 200 µg, and in 10.3% who received placebo; nausea occurred in 7.7%, 27.5%, 40.0%, 60.0%, and 7.7%, respectively; and headache occurred in 12.8%, 22.5%, 35.0%, 27.5%, and 23.1%.Conclusions and RelevanceIn participants with moderate to severe GAD, a single dose of MM120 produced a dose-dependent reduction in anxiety. These results support the dose-dependent efficacy of MM120 and inform the dose selection for phase 3 pivotal trials.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05407064

Abstract: In this Viewpoint, former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) caution that the sudden change in the ACIP may reverse the achievements of US immunization policy, including impeding access to lifesaving vaccines and putting US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses.

Abstract: ImportanceLimited pharmaceutical options exist for preexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 beyond vaccination. Azelastine, an antihistamine nasal spray used for decades to treat allergic rhinitis, has in vitro antiviral activity against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.ObjectiveTo determine the efficacy and safety of azelastine nasal spray for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthy adults.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center trial was conducted from March 2023 to July 2024. Healthy adults from the general population were enrolled at the Saarland University Hospital in Germany.InterventionsParticipants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive azelastine, 0.1%, nasal spray or placebo 3 times daily for 56 days. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen testing (RAT) was conducted twice weekly, with positive results confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Symptomatic participants with negative RAT results underwent multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses.Main OutcomeThe primary end point was the number of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study.ResultsA total of 450 participants were randomized, with 227 assigned to azelastine and 223 to placebo; 299 (66.4%) were female, 151 (33.6%) male, with a mean (SD) age of 33.0 (13.3) years. Most were White (417 [92.7%]), with 4 (0.9%) African, 22 (4.9%) Asian, and 7 (1.6%) of other ethnicity. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower in the azelastine group (n = 5 [2.2%]) compared with the placebo group (n = 15 [6.7%]) (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.87). As secondary end points, azelastine demonstrated an increase in mean (SD) time to SARS-CoV-2 infection among infected participants (31.2 [9.3] vs 19.5 [14.8] days), a reduction of the overall number of PCR-confirmed symptomatic infections (21 of 227 participants vs 49 of 223 participants), and a lower incidence of PCR-confirmed rhinovirus infections (1.8% vs 6.3%). Adverse events were comparable between the groups.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this single-center trial, azelastine nasal spray was associated with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections. These findings support the potential of azelastine as a safe prophylactic approach warranting confirmation in larger, multicentric trials.Trial registrationEudraCT number: 2022-003756-13
