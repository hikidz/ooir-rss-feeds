Abstract: ImportanceRecent scientific and policy statements suggest that child health may be worsening in the US.ObjectiveTo determine how US children’s health has been changing from 2007 to 2023 using multiple data collection methods and a comprehensive set of health indicators.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRepeated, cross-sectional analyses using mortality statistics from the US and 18 comparator high-income nations from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD18), 5 nationally representative surveys, and electronic health records from 10 pediatric health systems (PEDSnet). The populations included individuals younger than 20 years old. Unweighted denominator sample size ranges were 1623 to 95 677 across the surveys, 1 026 926 to 2 114 638 for PEDSnet, 81.9 million to 83.2 million in the US, and 118.4 million to 121.1 million in the OECD18 for mortality statistics.ExposureCalendar time.Main Outcomes and MeasuresRate ratios (RRs) and annual incidence for mortality and prevalence for chronic physical, developmental, and mental health conditions, functional status, and symptoms.ResultsFrom 2007 to 2022, infants (&amp;amp;amp;lt;1 year old) were 1.78 (95% CI, 1.78-1.79) and 1- to 19-year-old individuals were 1.80 (95% CI, 1.80-1.80) times more likely to die in the US than in the OECD18. The 2 causes of death with the largest net difference between the US and OECD18 were prematurity (RR, 2.22 [95% CI, 2.20-2.24]) and sudden unexpected infant death (RR, 2.39 [95% CI, 2.35-2.43]) for infants 12 months or younger, and firearm-related incidents (RR, 15.34 [95% CI, 14.89-15.80]) and motor vehicle crashes (RR, 2.45 [95% CI, 2.42-2.48]) for 1- to 19-year-old individuals. From 2011 to 2023, the prevalence of 3- to 17-year-old individuals with a chronic condition rose from 39.9% to 45.7% (RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.14-1.15]) within PEDSnet, and from 25.8% to 31.0% (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.20-1.20]) within the general population. Rates of obesity, early onset of menstruation, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, physical symptoms, depressive symptoms, and loneliness all increased during the study period.Conclusions and RelevanceThe health of US children has worsened across a wide range of health indicator domains over the past 17 years. The broad scope of this deterioration highlights the need to identify and address the root causes of this fundamental decline in the nation’s health.

Abstract: ImportanceIdentifying new interventions to slow and prevent cognitive decline associated with dementia is critical. Nonpharmacological interventions targeting modifiable risk factors are promising, relatively low-cost, accessible, and safe approaches.ObjectiveTo compare the effects of two 2-year lifestyle interventions on cognitive trajectory in older adults at risk of cognitive decline and dementia.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsSingle-blind, multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolling 2111 participants from May 2019 to March 2023 (final follow-up, May 14, 2025) at 5 clinical sites in the US. Participant inclusion criteria enriched risk of cognitive decline and included age 60 to 79 years, sedentary lifestyle, and suboptimal diet plus at least 2 additional criteria related to family history of memory impairment, cardiometabolic risk, race and ethnicity, older age, and sex.InterventionsParticipants were randomly assigned with equal probability to structured (n = 1056) or self-guided (n = 1055) interventions. Both interventions encouraged increased physical and cognitive activity, healthy diet, social engagement, and cardiovascular health monitoring, but differed in structure, intensity, and accountability.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary comparison was difference between intervention groups in annual rate of change in global cognitive function, assessed by a composite measure of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed, over 2 years.ResultsAmong the 2111 individuals enrolled (mean age, 68.2 [SD, 5.2] years; 1455 [68.9%] female), 89% completed the year 2 assessment. The mean global cognitive composite z score increased from baseline over time in both groups, with a mean rate of increase per year of 0.243 SD (95% CI, 0.227-0.258) for the structured intervention and 0.213 SD (95% CI, 0.198-0.229) for the self-guided intervention. The mean rate of increase per year was statistically significantly greater for the structured group than the self-guided group by 0.029 SD (95% CI, 0.008-0.050; P = .008). Based on prespecified secondary subgroup comparisons, the structured intervention benefit was consistent for APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers (P = .95 for interaction) but appeared greater for adults with lower vs higher baseline cognition (P = .02 for interaction). Fewer ascertained adverse events were reported in the structured group (serious: 151; nonserious: 1091) vs the self-guided group (serious: 190; nonserious: 1225), with a positive COVID-19 test result being the most common adverse event overall and more frequent in the structured group.Conclusions and RelevanceAmong older adults at risk of cognitive decline and dementia, a structured, higher-intensity intervention had a statistically significant greater benefit on global cognition compared with an unstructured, self-guided intervention. Further investigation of functional outcomes, biomarkers, and ongoing extended follow-up will help address clinical relevance and sustainability of the observed cognitive benefits.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03688126
