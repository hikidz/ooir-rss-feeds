Abstract:  Cortisol reactivity to acute stress predicts long-term health. Our novel findings show greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress in adults with habitual low fluid intake. Suboptimal hydration (e.g., darker morning urine) was associated with greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress. These findings provide one possible explanation for why habitual low fluid intake and suboptimal hydration are related to poor long-term health. Furthermore, researchers should account for hydration when assessing cortisol reactivity to acute stressors.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Growing concern surrounds the risk of neurodegenerative diseases in high-level collision sports, but research on Rugby Union's connection to these diseases is limited. 
          
          
            Objective
            This study sought to examine the long-term neurodegenerative disease risk associated with participation in high-level Rugby Union (‘rugby’), utilising whole-population administrative records.
          
          
            Methods
            This retrospective cohort study in New Zealand compared males born between 1920 and 1984 who were active in high-level (provincial or higher) rugby between 1950 and 2000 (n = 12,861) with males from the general population (n = 2,394,300), matched by age, ethnicity, and birthplace. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess risks of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, and other dementias, ascertained using mortality and hospitalisation records from January 1988 to June 2023.
          
          
            Results
            A higher percentage of rugby players (6.5%) than males in the general population (5.2%) developed neurodegenerative diseases, with hazard ratios indicating players showed increased risks for any neurodegenerative disease (1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.30), Alzheimer's disease (1.61; 95% CI 1.42–1.83), and other dementias (1.23; 95% CI 1.14–1.33). Significant differences were not observed for Parkinson’s disease (1.05; 95% CI 0.89–1.22) and motor neuron disease (1.16; 95% CI 0.83–1.63). In general, this increased risk among players compared to the general population began around the ages of 70–79 years. Compared to the general population, small to moderate increased risks of any neurodegenerative disease were observed for a backline playing position, provincial and/or amateur players, international and/or professional players, participation in ≥ 2 years of play, and participation in five or more matches.
          
          
            Conclusions
            High-level rugby participation amongst males in New Zealand is associated with a small to moderate increase in neurodegenerative disease rates compared to the general population.

			<title>Trans* Athletes in Sport: Not Ceding to the Sex/Gender Binary of Gender Critical Feminism1</title>

Abstract: Debates over the position(ing) of trans* athletes in sport have been reignited in the last decade because of the confluence of broader political debates over the provision of rights of self-identification for trans* people with the International Olympic Committee’s decision to place responsibility for transgender regulations in the hands of international sporting federations. The effect of this confluence has meant a regressive shift back toward hard essentialism with regard to sex categories in sport. This paper challenges the politically powerful, yet romanticized and historically inaccurate, narrative that so-called gender critical feminists have produced to support this regressive move.

Abstract: ABSTRACTThe aim of this study was to evaluate athletic performance and training in transgender women (TW) athletes competing in running and swimming both pre and post gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). Using survey methods, 9 TW runners and 1 TW swimmer provided independently verified retrospective data for race times, training volume, height, body mass, and testosterone, oestrogen and haemoglobin concentrations and pre‐GAHT and post‐GAHT. Prospective data were collected for a further 12 months. Changes in performance and age‐grade scores (AGs) for runners and FINA scores for the swimmer were calculated. For runners, pre‐GAHT and post‐GAHT differences in AGs were adjusted based on training differences over time. Post‐GAHT, testosterone concentrations in TW (1.10 ± 0.52 nmol·L−1) were female typical. Average race time for the runners increased by 14.6 ± 5.6% after 31 ± 23 months (range 5–86 months) of GAHT. Changes in training were positively associated with changes in AGs (p = 0.008). Pre‐GAHT and post‐GAHT average AGs of the runners did not differ with or without adjustment (p = 0.304) for training differences. Average race times for the swimmer increased by 5.2 ± 2.3% and FINA score increased by 65 points after 34 months of GAHT. In our sample of TW athletes taking GAHT, longer distance events were associated with larger decrements in performance compared with shorter distance events, with exercise training helping attenuate these decrements. Event demands and exercise training may be important considerations in understanding the effects of GAHT on athletic performance in TW athletes.
