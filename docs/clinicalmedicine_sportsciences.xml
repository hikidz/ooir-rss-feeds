Abstract: 
                    Objective
                    To examine the associations between the number of days per week achieving various daily step thresholds and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in older women.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    We conducted a prospective cohort study of 13 547 women free of CVD and cancer (mean age 71.8 years). We included participants who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 consecutive days between 2011–2015 and were subsequently followed for mortality through 2024. Women were classified by the number of days per week achieving step thresholds of ≥4000, ≥5000, ≥6000 or ≥7000 steps/day. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all-cause mortality and CVD incidence, adjusting for lifestyle behaviours and comorbidities.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    During a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 1765 women (13.0%) died and 781 (5.1%) developed CVD. Achieving ≥4000 steps/day on 1–2 and ≥3 days/week was associated with lower mortality risk compared with 0 days/week (adjusted HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.86) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.68), respectively). For CVD, corresponding results were 0.73 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.92) and 0.73 (95% CI 60 to 0.89), respectively. An inverse curvilinear dose-response relationship was observed for mortality, such that with higher step thresholds (5000, 6000 or 7000), the risk of mortality further declined modestly. With additional adjustment for mean daily steps, associations were attenuated to the null.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Among older women, achieving ≥4000 steps/day on even 1–2 days/week was associated with lower mortality and CVD, while more steps were associated with even better outcomes. A greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes.

Abstract: 
                  Objectives
                  To evaluate the effects of brief bouts of exercise spread throughout the day, termed ‘exercise snacks’, on cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and cardiometabolic health outcomes in physically inactive adults and older adults (aged ≥65 years).
               
               
                  Design
                  Systematic review and meta-analysis.
               
               
                  Data sources
                  Seven databases were searched from inception to April 2025.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults and older adults, comparing exercise snacks with non-exercising controls.
               
               
                  Results
                  11 RCTs (n=414; 69.1% women, mean age 18.7±0.8 to 74.2±5.6 years) were included. Exercise snacks were defined as structured bouts lasting ≤5 min, performed at least twice daily, ≥3 times/week, for ≥2 weeks. The interventions varied in duration (4–12 weeks), frequency (3–7 days/week) and intensity (moderate-to-vigorous to near-maximal). Exercise snacks significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness in adults (g=1.37, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.17; p&amp;lt;0.005; I2=71.4 %, k=6) and muscular endurance in older adults (g=0.40, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.75; p=0.02; I2=0 %, k=4), with moderate and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant effects were observed for lower limb muscular strength or cardiometabolic outcomes, including body composition, blood pressure and blood lipid profiles. High compliance (91.1%) and adherence (82.8%) rates were observed.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Moderate certainty of evidence indicated that exercise snacks improved cardiorespiratory fitness in physically inactive adults. However, evidence for benefits on muscular endurance in older adults was limited, and the current data do not support their effectiveness for improving other cardiometabolic health markers.

Abstract: 
                    
                      Background
                      :
                    
                    The role of high-volume low-intensity training for enhancing endurance performance has gained growing interest in recent years. Specifically, so-called “zone 2 training” is currently receiving much attention, and many propose that this is the target intensity at which a large proportion of total endurance training should be performed. However, despite the popularity of this concept, there is no clear consensus among coaches, athletes, and scientists regarding the definition of zone 2 training.
                    
                      Purpose
                      :
                    
                    This commentary summarizes the perspectives, experience, and knowledge of an expert panel of 14 applied sport scientists and professional coaches with the aim of providing insight and a basis for definitional consensus on zone 2 training. Moreover, potential training strategies at this intensity are proposed, and the expected physiological adaptations when exercising at this intensity and related research gaps are also discussed.
                    
                      Results
                      :
                    
                    Experts reached consensus that zone 2 training should preferably be performed at intensities located immediately below the first lactate or ventilatory threshold through continuous, variable, or interval-type sessions. Furthermore, experts expected a broad range of central and peripheral adaptations from zone 2 training. These expected adaptations might not be unique to zone 2 and could also be induced with sessions performed at slightly higher and lower intensities.
                    
                      Conclusions
                      :
                    
                    This commentary provides practical insight and unified criteria regarding the preferred intensity, duration, and session type for the optimization of zone 2 training based on the perspectives of acknowledged sport scientists and professional coaches.

			<title>Trans* Athletes in Sport: Not Ceding to the Sex/Gender Binary of Gender Critical Feminism1</title>

Abstract: Debates over the position(ing) of trans* athletes in sport have been reignited in the last decade because of the confluence of broader political debates over the provision of rights of self-identification for trans* people with the International Olympic Committee’s decision to place responsibility for transgender regulations in the hands of international sporting federations. The effect of this confluence has meant a regressive shift back toward hard essentialism with regard to sex categories in sport. This paper challenges the politically powerful, yet romanticized and historically inaccurate, narrative that so-called gender critical feminists have produced to support this regressive move.
