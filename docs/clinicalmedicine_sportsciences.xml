Abstract:  Shared pathways connect water regulation and cortisol release and exaggerated cortisol reactivity to stress is associated with poor long-term health. This study investigated the unknown influence of habitual fluid intake and hydration status on saliva cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress. After screening 62 healthy males and females and adopting low and high fluid intake quartiles from a national database, we identified 16 individuals with habitual low (LOW: 1.3 ± 0.4 L/day) and 16 with habitual high fluid intake (HIGH: 4.4 ± 1.2 L/day) who were comparable for factors likely to influence stress reactivity (e.g., trait anxiety). In pairs (one LOW and one HIGH), participants underwent 7 days of monitored habitual fluid intake. The following day, participants individually completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Hydration status was assessed in the days preceding and on the day of the TSST (urine osmolality and color; UOsm, UCol). Both UOsm and UCol were greater in LOW ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). The TSST evoked similar increases in state anxiety and heart rate in LOW and HIGH, yet saliva cortisol increased significantly post-TSST only in LOW (group*time interaction, P = 0.02). Moreover, cortisol reactivity was greater in LOW (Δ, 6.2 ± 2.9 vs. HIGH: 4.0 ± 1.8 nmol/L; P = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.9) and was associated with hydration status assessed as UOsm (Pearson R = 0.7, P &amp;lt; 0.001). These novel findings show greater cortisol reactivity to acute psychosocial stress in adults with habitual low fluid intake and suboptimal hydration, which may influence long-term health.

Abstract: 
                  Objective
                  To undertake a contemporary review of the impact of exercise based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
               
               
                  Data sources
                  CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, WoS Core Collection, LILACS and trial registers were searched from inception up to 24 March 2024.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing ExCR with any non-exercise control.
               
               
                  Design
                  Random effect meta-analyses presented as effect estimates and 95% CIs. Meta-regression examined study level effect modification. Cochrane risk of bias, GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and trial sequential analysis (RTSA) were applied.
               
               
                  Results
                  20 RCTs (n=2039) with a mean follow-up of 11 months showed that ExCR did not impact all cause mortality (8.3% vs 6.0%, relative risk (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48) or serious adverse events (2.9% vs 4.1%, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56) but did reduce AF symptom severity (mean difference (MD) −1.61, 95% CI −3.06 to −0.16), AF burden (MD −1.61, 95% CI −2.76 to −0.45), episode frequency (MD −0.57, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.07), episode duration (MD −0.58, 95% CI −1.14 to −0.03), AF recurrence (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89), and improved exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) MD 3.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.31 mL/kg/min). There was benefit for the mental component but not the physical component of a health related quality of life questionnaire. No differential effects across AF subtype, ExCR dose, or mode of delivery were seen.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Meta-analyses of RCT evidence for ExCR in patients with AF demonstrated several clinical benefits without an increase in serious adverse events. GRADE and RTSA assessments indicated further high quality and adequately powered RCTs are needed.

			<title>Trans* Athletes in Sport: Not Ceding to the Sex/Gender Binary of Gender Critical Feminism1</title>

Abstract: Debates over the position(ing) of trans* athletes in sport have been reignited in the last decade because of the confluence of broader political debates over the provision of rights of self-identification for trans* people with the International Olympic Committee’s decision to place responsibility for transgender regulations in the hands of international sporting federations. The effect of this confluence has meant a regressive shift back toward hard essentialism with regard to sex categories in sport. This paper challenges the politically powerful, yet romanticized and historically inaccurate, narrative that so-called gender critical feminists have produced to support this regressive move.
