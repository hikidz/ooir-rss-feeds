Abstract:  Cortisol reactivity to acute stress predicts long-term health. Our novel findings show greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress in adults with habitual low fluid intake. Suboptimal hydration (e.g., darker morning urine) was associated with greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress. These findings provide one possible explanation for why habitual low fluid intake and suboptimal hydration are related to poor long-term health. Furthermore, researchers should account for hydration when assessing cortisol reactivity to acute stressors.

Abstract: ABSTRACTThis systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to investigate the impact of exercise snacks (ExSn), which involve incorporating short bursts of high‐intensity physical activity into daily routines, on improving cardiometabolic health and body composition in adults. Six online databases [PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and Scopus] were searched from inception through 22 May 2025, and relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomized controlled trials (non‐RCTs) were identified. Outcomes were analyzed using standardized mean differences and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on physical activity levels and duration for each bout of ExSn. The GRADE scale was used to assess evidence certainty, while the revised Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool (RoB 2) was used to evaluate the quality of RCTs, and the Risk of Bias In Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS‐I) tool was used for non‐RCTs. Twelve RCTs and two non‐RCTs, involving a total of 483 adults, were selected for the systematic review; 13 studies were included in the meta‐analysis. Among the RCTs, 2 studies showed a high risk of bias, and 10 showed some concerns. For the non‐RCTs, 1 study had a moderate risk of bias, and 1 had a serious risk of bias. The ExSn group showed significant improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (SMD = 1.43, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.25, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and peak power output (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.36, p = 0.050), and reductions in total cholesterol (SMD = −0.65, 95% CI −1.18 to −0.11, p = 0.018) and LDL cholesterol (SMD = −0.65, 95% CI −1.22 to −0.09, p = 0.023). No significant differences were found for body weight, body fat, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides. ExSn significantly enhances cardiometabolic health, especially in physically inactive adults. As a novel, time‐efficient approach, ExSn can be easily integrated into daily routines, offering a practical solution for sedentary and inactive individuals or those with limited time. These findings highlight its potential as a widely applicable public health strategy, warranting further research on long‐term effects and broader applications.PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42024554446

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Growing concern surrounds the risk of neurodegenerative diseases in high-level collision sports, but research on Rugby Union's connection to these diseases is limited. 
          
          
            Objective
            This study sought to examine the long-term neurodegenerative disease risk associated with participation in high-level Rugby Union (‘rugby’), utilising whole-population administrative records.
          
          
            Methods
            This retrospective cohort study in New Zealand compared males born between 1920 and 1984 who were active in high-level (provincial or higher) rugby between 1950 and 2000 (n = 12,861) with males from the general population (n = 2,394,300), matched by age, ethnicity, and birthplace. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess risks of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, and other dementias, ascertained using mortality and hospitalisation records from January 1988 to June 2023.
          
          
            Results
            A higher percentage of rugby players (6.5%) than males in the general population (5.2%) developed neurodegenerative diseases, with hazard ratios indicating players showed increased risks for any neurodegenerative disease (1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.30), Alzheimer's disease (1.61; 95% CI 1.42–1.83), and other dementias (1.23; 95% CI 1.14–1.33). Significant differences were not observed for Parkinson’s disease (1.05; 95% CI 0.89–1.22) and motor neuron disease (1.16; 95% CI 0.83–1.63). In general, this increased risk among players compared to the general population began around the ages of 70–79 years. Compared to the general population, small to moderate increased risks of any neurodegenerative disease were observed for a backline playing position, provincial and/or amateur players, international and/or professional players, participation in ≥ 2 years of play, and participation in five or more matches.
          
          
            Conclusions
            High-level rugby participation amongst males in New Zealand is associated with a small to moderate increase in neurodegenerative disease rates compared to the general population.

			<title>Trans* Athletes in Sport: Not Ceding to the Sex/Gender Binary of Gender Critical Feminism1</title>

Abstract: Debates over the position(ing) of trans* athletes in sport have been reignited in the last decade because of the confluence of broader political debates over the provision of rights of self-identification for trans* people with the International Olympic Committee’s decision to place responsibility for transgender regulations in the hands of international sporting federations. The effect of this confluence has meant a regressive shift back toward hard essentialism with regard to sex categories in sport. This paper challenges the politically powerful, yet romanticized and historically inaccurate, narrative that so-called gender critical feminists have produced to support this regressive move.
