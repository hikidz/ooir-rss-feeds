Abstract:  Cortisol reactivity to acute stress predicts long-term health. Our novel findings show greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress in adults with habitual low fluid intake. Suboptimal hydration (e.g., darker morning urine) was associated with greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress. These findings provide one possible explanation for why habitual low fluid intake and suboptimal hydration are related to poor long-term health. Furthermore, researchers should account for hydration when assessing cortisol reactivity to acute stressors.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Growing concern surrounds the risk of neurodegenerative diseases in high-level collision sports, but research on Rugby Union's connection to these diseases is limited. 
          
          
            Objective
            This study sought to examine the long-term neurodegenerative disease risk associated with participation in high-level Rugby Union (‘rugby’), utilising whole-population administrative records.
          
          
            Methods
            This retrospective cohort study in New Zealand compared males born between 1920 and 1984 who were active in high-level (provincial or higher) rugby between 1950 and 2000 (n = 12,861) with males from the general population (n = 2,394,300), matched by age, ethnicity, and birthplace. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess risks of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, and other dementias, ascertained using mortality and hospitalisation records from January 1988 to June 2023.
          
          
            Results
            A higher percentage of rugby players (6.5%) than males in the general population (5.2%) developed neurodegenerative diseases, with hazard ratios indicating players showed increased risks for any neurodegenerative disease (1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.30), Alzheimer's disease (1.61; 95% CI 1.42–1.83), and other dementias (1.23; 95% CI 1.14–1.33). Significant differences were not observed for Parkinson’s disease (1.05; 95% CI 0.89–1.22) and motor neuron disease (1.16; 95% CI 0.83–1.63). In general, this increased risk among players compared to the general population began around the ages of 70–79 years. Compared to the general population, small to moderate increased risks of any neurodegenerative disease were observed for a backline playing position, provincial and/or amateur players, international and/or professional players, participation in ≥ 2 years of play, and participation in five or more matches.
          
          
            Conclusions
            High-level rugby participation amongst males in New Zealand is associated with a small to moderate increase in neurodegenerative disease rates compared to the general population.

			<title>Trans* Athletes in Sport: Not Ceding to the Sex/Gender Binary of Gender Critical Feminism1</title>

Abstract: Debates over the position(ing) of trans* athletes in sport have been reignited in the last decade because of the confluence of broader political debates over the provision of rights of self-identification for trans* people with the International Olympic Committee’s decision to place responsibility for transgender regulations in the hands of international sporting federations. The effect of this confluence has meant a regressive shift back toward hard essentialism with regard to sex categories in sport. This paper challenges the politically powerful, yet romanticized and historically inaccurate, narrative that so-called gender critical feminists have produced to support this regressive move.

Abstract: Abstract
          The optimisation of muscle recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is a major issue in sports medicine. This comprehensive review examines the effects of four environmental stressors, including cold (cold therapy), heat (heat therapy), hot–cold alternation (contrast therapy) and reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia therapy), on muscle recovery following EIMD. The analysis of related randomised controlled trials assessed the influences of these stressors on five markers of recovery (muscular performance, joint amplitude, muscle pain, swelling and blood biomarkers). Although cold therapy has been widely studied, the lack of consensus on its application modalities leads to controversial debates regarding its effectiveness for muscle recovery. Heat therapy, particularly hot water immersion, appears to be the most effective method for restoring muscle function. However, the use of local heating techniques is less well understood. Moreover, contrast therapy seems to be promising for reducing swelling post-EIMD; however, the lack of studies and the variety of utilised techniques involving contrast therapy limit conclusions. Finally, local hypoxia, which is elicited by intermittent blood flow restriction, demonstrates potential for reducing inflammation and improving the recovery of muscle function, based on the appropriate application of protocols. By synthesising existing data, this comprehensive review shows that most environmental stress-based therapies can be effective, if the modalities of application—such as dose or frequency—are appropriate. It offers practical recommendations for optimising muscle recovery. This review also highlights the need for further research to refine protocols and better understand the potential synergistic effects of these environmental stress-based interventions.
