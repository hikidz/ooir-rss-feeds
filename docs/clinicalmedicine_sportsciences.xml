Abstract: 
                  Objective
                  To understand the associations of trajectories and accumulation of physical activity (PA) over adulthood with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality.
               
               
                  Design
                  Systematic review and meta-analyses.
               
               
                  Data sources
                  PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and reference lists of included studies.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Population-based prospective studies with (1) non-clinical adult population, (2) PA assessed ≥2 timepoints as exposure, (3) all-cause, CVD or cancer mortality as outcomes with risk measures, and (4) publication up to 9 April 2024 and in English.
               
               
                  Results
                  85 studies with three main types of PA exposure (ie, trajectory, time-varying, and cumulative/average) were included. Of these, 77 assessed all-cause mortality, 34 assessed CVD mortality, and 15 assessed cancer mortality. Overall, higher PA was associated with lower risks of all outcomes. Consistently and increasingly active individuals had around 20–40% lower risk of all-cause mortality and 30-40% lower risk of CVD mortality; however, the associations with decreasing PA patterns were less evident. Time-varying and cumulative/average PA illustrated similar inverse associations between higher PA levels and all-cause and CVD mortality. The associations were weaker and less robust for cancer mortality. Non-linear dose-response associations suggested risk reductions in all-cause and CVD mortality for meeting PA guidelines, but consistent/increasing PA below the guidelines also provided health benefits.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Consistently/increasingly accumulated PA over adulthood can reduce the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality, while the health benefits from decreasing PA patterns require further exploration.

Abstract: 
                  Objectives
                  We explored whether a spike in running distance during a single session or over 1 week, compared with the preceding period, was associated with increased risk of running-related overuse injury.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Adult runners were recruited for an 18-month cohort study. Three training-related exposures were defined based on a relative change in running distance, using data collected via Garmin devices: (1) session-specific running distance relative to the longest distance run in the past 30 days; (2) 1-week period relative to the preceding 3 weeks using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR); (3) 1-week period using a week-to-week ratio. Runners were categorised into one of four time-varying states: (1) regression, or up to 10% increase (reference); (2) ‘small spike’ between &amp;gt;10% and 30% increase; (3) ‘moderate spike’ between &amp;gt;30% and 100% increase; and (4) ‘large spike’ &amp;gt;100% increase. Outcome was self-reported overuse running-related injury. A multistate Cox regression model was used to estimate adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRR).
               
               
                  Results
                  Among 5205 runners (mean age 45.8 years, SD=10.4; 22% female), a total of 1820 (35%) sustained a running-related injury during 588 071 sessions. Significantly increased rates were identified for small spikes (HRR=1.64 (95% CI: 1.31 to 2.05, p=0.01)), moderate spikes (HRR=1.52 (95% CI: 1.16 to 2.00, p&amp;lt;0.01)) and large spikes (HRR=2.28 (95% CI: 1.50 to 3.48, p&amp;lt;0.01)) in single-session running distance. A negative dose-response relationship was observed for the ACWR. No relationship was identified for the week-to-week ratio.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  A significant increase in the rate of running-related overuse injury was found when the distance of a single running session exceeded 10% of the longest run undertaken in the last 30 days.

Abstract: ABSTRACTHere, we assessed the prevalence of post‐COVID‐condition (PCC, also known as long‐COVID) and investigated its associations with health‐related quality of life and immune‐related biomarkers in track and field masters athletes (MAs). A total of 216 MAs (114 males, 102 females; age: 58.3 ± 11.9 vs. 56.6 ± 11.7 years; BMI: 23.6 [22.2–24.8] vs. 21.3 [20.0–23.6] kg/m2) reported their post‐COVID‐conditions via the Post‐COVID Syndrome Questionnaire (PCSQ). In a subgroup of 108 MAs, fasting blood samples were collected to assess C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels as a biomarker of immune status (MAs‐CRP). Based on their PCSQ sum score, MAs were divided into three groups: no/mild, moderate, and severe. Associations between PCC severity and sex, athletic specialty, and competition level were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Forty‐six (21%) MAs were identified with clinically relevant moderate‐to‐severe post‐COVID‐19 conditions (PCSQ score &amp;gt; 10.75). The most frequently reported symptoms included musculoskeletal pain (15%), sleep disturbance (13%), sensory or respiratory symptoms (11%), fatigue (11%), and flu‐like symptoms (11%). PCC prevalence did not differ by sex, athletic specialties, training load, or prior competition level (all p &amp;gt; 0.05). MAs with moderate‐to‐severe PCC had significantly lower physical and mental component scores of quality of life compared with those with no or mild symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In the MAs‐CRP subgroup, self‐reported cardiac ailments and flu‐like symptoms were significantly and positively associated with CRP levels (Spearman ρ = 0.27–0.30, all p &amp;lt; 0.01). Post‐COVID‐19 condition is associated with reduced quality of life in track and field masters athletes, independent of sex, prior competition levels, and training characteristics. Furthermore, low‐grade inflammation based on CRP levels was associated with self‐reported cardiac and flu‐like symptoms.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            A common belief amongst patients and clinicians is that anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is required to return to sport. It is not clear if this belief is supported by the best available research.
          
          
            Objective
            We aimed to compare return-to-sport and activity levels following anterior cruciate ligament rupture managed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction versus rehabilitation alone.
          
          
            Methods
            We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search was conducted across seven electronic databases for empirical studies published to July 2023. Articles were included if they assessed return-to-sport and/or activity levels in two groups where one underwent an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and the other had exercise-based rehabilitation that was standardised and/or supervised by a healthcare professional. In addition to narrative syntheses, random-effect meta-analyses were conducted for return-to-sport and activity participation (Tegner Activity Scale). The protocol was pre-registered (PROSPERO CRD42022313507).
          
          
            Results
            Eighteen articles reporting on 15 studies (two randomised controlled trials) met inclusion criteria. Ten studies had a high risk of confounding bias that was likely to favour anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction including biases in group allocation and differences in activity and return-to-sport advice between groups. The findings suggest that anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was not associated with higher return-to-sport rates (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.76–2.97) compared to rehabilitation alone. A small difference favouring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was observed for Tegner Activity Scale scores (mean difference 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.16–1.24) that did not exceed the minimal detectable change and no difference was observed after excluding studies with a high risk of confounding bias. Insufficient data were available for time to return to sport and physical activity levels. The evidence is of low or very low certainty because of the heterogeneity of results and the high risk of bias in the included studies.
          
          
            Conclusions
            There was no difference in return-to-sport rates or activity levels when comparing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with rehabilitation alone for the management of anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Abstract: 
                  Objective
                  Resistance training (RT) has wide-ranging health benefits that may extend to pregnancy. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the influence of RT as a sole intervention or as part of a multicomponent exercise programme on pregnancy, delivery, fetal and pelvic floor outcomes.
               
               
                  Design
                  A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Risk of bias was performed using the Johanna Briggs Institute risk of bias tool.
               
               
                  Data sources
                  Six databases were searched from inception to 15 March 2024.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Studies were eligible for inclusion if pregnant individuals performed a RT intervention of any intensity, compared with usual care or a non-RT intervention. Outcomes included pregnancy outcomes (rates of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and perinatal mood disorders), delivery outcomes (rates of caesarean section, perineal tearing, instrumented delivery and length of labour), fetal outcomes (birth mass, microsomia, macrosomia and gestational age) and rates of pelvic floor disorders.
               
               
                  Results
                  Overall, 50 studies (47 619 participants) from 14 countries were included in this review. There were 45 randomised controlled trials, 3 non-randomised interventions and 2 observational studies. Sixteen studies were considered low risk of bias, 27 studies were of moderate risk of bias and seven were classified as high risk of bias. Ninety per cent of studies were multicomponent programmes, and the dosage of RT interventions was generally low-to-moderate. Reporting of RT prescription, progression and use of appropriate loading guidance was poor. RT was associated with a reduction in the odds of gestational hypertension (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66; I2=0%), gestational diabetes (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; I2=0%), perinatal mood disorders (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.73; I2=0%) and macrosomia (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.88; I2=23%) compared with control groups.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  RT, alone or as part of a multicomponent intervention, has significant health benefits during pregnancy. As the majority of interventions are multicomponent, and the aerobic programmes are more appropriately dosed, understanding the impact of RT on the pregnant person is challenging, and studies using currently accepted RT guidelines for exercise dosage and progression are needed.
