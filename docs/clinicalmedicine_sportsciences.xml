Abstract:  Cortisol reactivity to acute stress predicts long-term health. Our novel findings show greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress in adults with habitual low fluid intake. Suboptimal hydration (e.g., darker morning urine) was associated with greater cortisol reactivity to acute stress. These findings provide one possible explanation for why habitual low fluid intake and suboptimal hydration are related to poor long-term health. Furthermore, researchers should account for hydration when assessing cortisol reactivity to acute stressors.

			<title>Trans* Athletes in Sport: Not Ceding to the Sex/Gender Binary of Gender Critical Feminism1</title>

Abstract: Debates over the position(ing) of trans* athletes in sport have been reignited in the last decade because of the confluence of broader political debates over the provision of rights of self-identification for trans* people with the International Olympic Committee’s decision to place responsibility for transgender regulations in the hands of international sporting federations. The effect of this confluence has meant a regressive shift back toward hard essentialism with regard to sex categories in sport. This paper challenges the politically powerful, yet romanticized and historically inaccurate, narrative that so-called gender critical feminists have produced to support this regressive move.

Abstract: ABSTRACTThe aim of this study was to evaluate athletic performance and training in transgender women (TW) athletes competing in running and swimming both pre and post gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). Using survey methods, 9 TW runners and 1 TW swimmer provided independently verified retrospective data for race times, training volume, height, body mass, and testosterone, oestrogen and haemoglobin concentrations and pre‐GAHT and post‐GAHT. Prospective data were collected for a further 12 months. Changes in performance and age‐grade scores (AGs) for runners and FINA scores for the swimmer were calculated. For runners, pre‐GAHT and post‐GAHT differences in AGs were adjusted based on training differences over time. Post‐GAHT, testosterone concentrations in TW (1.10 ± 0.52 nmol·L−1) were female typical. Average race time for the runners increased by 14.6 ± 5.6% after 31 ± 23 months (range 5–86 months) of GAHT. Changes in training were positively associated with changes in AGs (p = 0.008). Pre‐GAHT and post‐GAHT average AGs of the runners did not differ with or without adjustment (p = 0.304) for training differences. Average race times for the swimmer increased by 5.2 ± 2.3% and FINA score increased by 65 points after 34 months of GAHT. In our sample of TW athletes taking GAHT, longer distance events were associated with larger decrements in performance compared with shorter distance events, with exercise training helping attenuate these decrements. Event demands and exercise training may be important considerations in understanding the effects of GAHT on athletic performance in TW athletes.

Abstract: ABSTRACTThe International Consensus Conference “Optimising Performance of the Elite Athlete,” held in November 2024, brought together 29 scientists, some coaches, and athletes to establish evidence‐based consensus statements aimed at enhancing elite athletic performance and health. The conference addressed critical themes including training strategies, nutrition, female athlete considerations, injury management, and emerging technologies. Key conclusions emphasize individualized, sport‐specific approaches to training and nutrition, integrating concurrent training modalities to improve endurance, resilience, and efficiency. Nutrition strategies highlight the importance of tailored energy and macronutrient periodization, recognition of low energy availability risks, and cautious use of dietary supplements. Special attention was directed to female athletes, advocating for improved monitoring of menstrual cycles and hormonal status, while acknowledging current knowledge gaps in hormonal influences on performance and injury risk. Injury prevention remains a challenge, with tendon overuse and Achilles tendon ruptures significantly impacting athlete careers; rehabilitation should rely on criteria‐based progression and multidisciplinary input. Emerging technologies, including wearable sensors and multi‐omics analyses, hold promise for personalized training and nutrition but require further validation in elite contexts. Despite robust consensus, the panel identified substantial research gaps, particularly regarding female athletes, longitudinal training effects, and efficacy of novel interventions. This consensus provides a practical, scientifically grounded framework to optimize elite athlete performance and health, while underscoring the need for continued research to address outstanding questions and promote inclusive evidence‐based practices.
