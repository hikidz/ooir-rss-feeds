Abstract: 
                  Objective
                  To undertake a contemporary review of the impact of exercise based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
               
               
                  Data sources
                  CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, WoS Core Collection, LILACS and trial registers were searched from inception up to 24 March 2024.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing ExCR with any non-exercise control.
               
               
                  Design
                  Random effect meta-analyses presented as effect estimates and 95% CIs. Meta-regression examined study level effect modification. Cochrane risk of bias, GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and trial sequential analysis (RTSA) were applied.
               
               
                  Results
                  20 RCTs (n=2039) with a mean follow-up of 11 months showed that ExCR did not impact all cause mortality (8.3% vs 6.0%, relative risk (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48) or serious adverse events (2.9% vs 4.1%, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56) but did reduce AF symptom severity (mean difference (MD) −1.61, 95% CI −3.06 to −0.16), AF burden (MD −1.61, 95% CI −2.76 to −0.45), episode frequency (MD −0.57, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.07), episode duration (MD −0.58, 95% CI −1.14 to −0.03), AF recurrence (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89), and improved exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) MD 3.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.31 mL/kg/min). There was benefit for the mental component but not the physical component of a health related quality of life questionnaire. No differential effects across AF subtype, ExCR dose, or mode of delivery were seen.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Meta-analyses of RCT evidence for ExCR in patients with AF demonstrated several clinical benefits without an increase in serious adverse events. GRADE and RTSA assessments indicated further high quality and adequately powered RCTs are needed.

Abstract: ABSTRACTHere, we assessed the prevalence of post‐COVID‐condition (PCC, also known as long‐COVID) and investigated its associations with health‐related quality of life and immune‐related biomarkers in track and field masters athletes (MAs). A total of 216 MAs (114 males, 102 females; age: 58.3 ± 11.9 vs. 56.6 ± 11.7 years; BMI: 23.6 [22.2–24.8] vs. 21.3 [20.0–23.6] kg/m2) reported their post‐COVID‐conditions via the Post‐COVID Syndrome Questionnaire (PCSQ). In a subgroup of 108 MAs, fasting blood samples were collected to assess C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels as a biomarker of immune status (MAs‐CRP). Based on their PCSQ sum score, MAs were divided into three groups: no/mild, moderate, and severe. Associations between PCC severity and sex, athletic specialty, and competition level were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Forty‐six (21%) MAs were identified with clinically relevant moderate‐to‐severe post‐COVID‐19 conditions (PCSQ score &amp;gt; 10.75). The most frequently reported symptoms included musculoskeletal pain (15%), sleep disturbance (13%), sensory or respiratory symptoms (11%), fatigue (11%), and flu‐like symptoms (11%). PCC prevalence did not differ by sex, athletic specialties, training load, or prior competition level (all p &amp;gt; 0.05). MAs with moderate‐to‐severe PCC had significantly lower physical and mental component scores of quality of life compared with those with no or mild symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In the MAs‐CRP subgroup, self‐reported cardiac ailments and flu‐like symptoms were significantly and positively associated with CRP levels (Spearman ρ = 0.27–0.30, all p &amp;lt; 0.01). Post‐COVID‐19 condition is associated with reduced quality of life in track and field masters athletes, independent of sex, prior competition levels, and training characteristics. Furthermore, low‐grade inflammation based on CRP levels was associated with self‐reported cardiac and flu‐like symptoms.

Abstract: ABSTRACTDisc golf is becoming increasingly popular, but there is no published information on performance differences between males and females. The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in disc golf performance in recent years and to discuss the implications of these sex differences on eligibility criteria for women's disc golf competitions. We used publicly available data sources from the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) and Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT) to compile performance data related to player ratings, throwing distance, throwing accuracy, and putting success at the professional, amateur, and junior levels. In the Pro class (n = 16,843), the median male player rating was 936 compared with 851 for females (P &amp;lt; 0.001). In the amateurs, over 5000 males had a higher rating than the best female player. In throwing for distance, males threw 23%–54% further than females (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Differences in accuracy were smaller but significant, with males outperforming females in measures of throwing accuracy in the Pro class (average 70.9% vs. 63.4% fairway hits; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and putting consistency (median 82% vs. 69%; P &amp;lt; 0.001). In junior competitions, boys showed higher ratings and better performance than girls, with clear differences already observed at age 10 (e.g., median rating 775 vs. 529; P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, male disc golfers outperformed female players in player rating, throwing distance, and accuracy in the professional, amateur, and junior divisions. Disc golf governing bodies struggling with setting eligibility criteria for women's disc golf competitions may use these results to better inform policy.
