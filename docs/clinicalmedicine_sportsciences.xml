Abstract: 
                  Objective
                  To understand the associations of trajectories and accumulation of physical activity (PA) over adulthood with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality.
               
               
                  Design
                  Systematic review and meta-analyses.
               
               
                  Data sources
                  PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and reference lists of included studies.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Population-based prospective studies with (1) non-clinical adult population, (2) PA assessed ≥2 timepoints as exposure, (3) all-cause, CVD or cancer mortality as outcomes with risk measures, and (4) publication up to 9 April 2024 and in English.
               
               
                  Results
                  85 studies with three main types of PA exposure (ie, trajectory, time-varying, and cumulative/average) were included. Of these, 77 assessed all-cause mortality, 34 assessed CVD mortality, and 15 assessed cancer mortality. Overall, higher PA was associated with lower risks of all outcomes. Consistently and increasingly active individuals had around 20–40% lower risk of all-cause mortality and 30-40% lower risk of CVD mortality; however, the associations with decreasing PA patterns were less evident. Time-varying and cumulative/average PA illustrated similar inverse associations between higher PA levels and all-cause and CVD mortality. The associations were weaker and less robust for cancer mortality. Non-linear dose-response associations suggested risk reductions in all-cause and CVD mortality for meeting PA guidelines, but consistent/increasing PA below the guidelines also provided health benefits.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Consistently/increasingly accumulated PA over adulthood can reduce the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality, while the health benefits from decreasing PA patterns require further exploration.

Abstract: 
                  Objective
                  To undertake a contemporary review of the impact of exercise based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
               
               
                  Data sources
                  CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, WoS Core Collection, LILACS and trial registers were searched from inception up to 24 March 2024.
               
               
                  Eligibility criteria
                  Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing ExCR with any non-exercise control.
               
               
                  Design
                  Random effect meta-analyses presented as effect estimates and 95% CIs. Meta-regression examined study level effect modification. Cochrane risk of bias, GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and trial sequential analysis (RTSA) were applied.
               
               
                  Results
                  20 RCTs (n=2039) with a mean follow-up of 11 months showed that ExCR did not impact all cause mortality (8.3% vs 6.0%, relative risk (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48) or serious adverse events (2.9% vs 4.1%, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56) but did reduce AF symptom severity (mean difference (MD) −1.61, 95% CI −3.06 to −0.16), AF burden (MD −1.61, 95% CI −2.76 to −0.45), episode frequency (MD −0.57, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.07), episode duration (MD −0.58, 95% CI −1.14 to −0.03), AF recurrence (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89), and improved exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) MD 3.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.31 mL/kg/min). There was benefit for the mental component but not the physical component of a health related quality of life questionnaire. No differential effects across AF subtype, ExCR dose, or mode of delivery were seen.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Meta-analyses of RCT evidence for ExCR in patients with AF demonstrated several clinical benefits without an increase in serious adverse events. GRADE and RTSA assessments indicated further high quality and adequately powered RCTs are needed.

Abstract: 
                  Objectives
                  We explored whether a spike in running distance during a single session or over 1 week, compared with the preceding period, was associated with increased risk of running-related overuse injury.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Adult runners were recruited for an 18-month cohort study. Three training-related exposures were defined based on a relative change in running distance, using data collected via Garmin devices: (1) session-specific running distance relative to the longest distance run in the past 30 days; (2) 1-week period relative to the preceding 3 weeks using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR); (3) 1-week period using a week-to-week ratio. Runners were categorised into one of four time-varying states: (1) regression, or up to 10% increase (reference); (2) ‘small spike’ between &amp;gt;10% and 30% increase; (3) ‘moderate spike’ between &amp;gt;30% and 100% increase; and (4) ‘large spike’ &amp;gt;100% increase. Outcome was self-reported overuse running-related injury. A multistate Cox regression model was used to estimate adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRR).
               
               
                  Results
                  Among 5205 runners (mean age 45.8 years, SD=10.4; 22% female), a total of 1820 (35%) sustained a running-related injury during 588 071 sessions. Significantly increased rates were identified for small spikes (HRR=1.64 (95% CI: 1.31 to 2.05, p=0.01)), moderate spikes (HRR=1.52 (95% CI: 1.16 to 2.00, p&amp;lt;0.01)) and large spikes (HRR=2.28 (95% CI: 1.50 to 3.48, p&amp;lt;0.01)) in single-session running distance. A negative dose-response relationship was observed for the ACWR. No relationship was identified for the week-to-week ratio.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  A significant increase in the rate of running-related overuse injury was found when the distance of a single running session exceeded 10% of the longest run undertaken in the last 30 days.

Abstract: ABSTRACTHere, we assessed the prevalence of post‐COVID‐condition (PCC, also known as long‐COVID) and investigated its associations with health‐related quality of life and immune‐related biomarkers in track and field masters athletes (MAs). A total of 216 MAs (114 males, 102 females; age: 58.3 ± 11.9 vs. 56.6 ± 11.7 years; BMI: 23.6 [22.2–24.8] vs. 21.3 [20.0–23.6] kg/m2) reported their post‐COVID‐conditions via the Post‐COVID Syndrome Questionnaire (PCSQ). In a subgroup of 108 MAs, fasting blood samples were collected to assess C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels as a biomarker of immune status (MAs‐CRP). Based on their PCSQ sum score, MAs were divided into three groups: no/mild, moderate, and severe. Associations between PCC severity and sex, athletic specialty, and competition level were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Forty‐six (21%) MAs were identified with clinically relevant moderate‐to‐severe post‐COVID‐19 conditions (PCSQ score &amp;gt; 10.75). The most frequently reported symptoms included musculoskeletal pain (15%), sleep disturbance (13%), sensory or respiratory symptoms (11%), fatigue (11%), and flu‐like symptoms (11%). PCC prevalence did not differ by sex, athletic specialties, training load, or prior competition level (all p &amp;gt; 0.05). MAs with moderate‐to‐severe PCC had significantly lower physical and mental component scores of quality of life compared with those with no or mild symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In the MAs‐CRP subgroup, self‐reported cardiac ailments and flu‐like symptoms were significantly and positively associated with CRP levels (Spearman ρ = 0.27–0.30, all p &amp;lt; 0.01). Post‐COVID‐19 condition is associated with reduced quality of life in track and field masters athletes, independent of sex, prior competition levels, and training characteristics. Furthermore, low‐grade inflammation based on CRP levels was associated with self‐reported cardiac and flu‐like symptoms.
