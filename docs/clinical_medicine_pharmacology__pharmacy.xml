Abstract: 
                    Introduction
                    Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal gynecological malignancy, often diagnosed at advanced stages. Cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) demonstrate anti-tumor activity in various cancers including ovarian cancer through multiple signaling pathways and are increasingly explored as adjuncts to chemotherapy. However, the effects of CBD and THC combination treatment and its specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated the anti-tumor effects of CBD, THC, and their combination on SKOV3 and A2780 ovarian cancer cells, focusing on phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    SKOV3, A2780, and IOSE cells were treated with CBD, THC, and equimolar CBD: THC combinations. Cytotoxicity was assessed using Sulforhodamine B assay, while synergistic interactions were analyzed by the Chou-Talay method using CompuSyn. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were evaluated, and phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN was examined by Western blotting.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      The CBD: THC combination treatment showed potent, selective cytotoxicity at 48 h, with lower IC
                      50
                      values than in non-tumor IOSE80 cells. The Chou–Talalay method validated a synergistic effect between CBD and THC. The combination treatment induced cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. Western blot analysis exhibited that equimolar CBD: THC (2.5:2.5 μM) markedly reduced phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, while increasing phosphorylation of PTEN, thereby reactivating tumor-suppressive signaling.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    
                      These findings highlight that CBD: THC combination treatment effectively inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth and invasion via oncogenic PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and reactivates PTEN. The combination may represent a promising targeted therapeutic approach, warranting further

                      validation to elucidate its clinical potential.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Purpose
                    Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are essential healthcare professionals with limited data on their risk for suicide.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    Using the National Violent Death Reporting System, pharmacist, pharmacy technician, and general population suicides (for individuals 25 years of age or older) were identified. Suicide incidence was estimated from 2011 to 2022 due to data limitations, while suicide characteristics (preceding circumstances, method, and toxicology) were analyzed in adjusted Firth logistic regression models from 2005 to 2022.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    A total of 369 pharmacist (87 [24%] female), 243 pharmacy technician (149 [61%] female), and 245,114 general population (52,890 [22%] female) suicides were found for the period from 2011 to 2022. When data were standardized by sex, pharmacists had a higher risk of suicide (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.34) while pharmacy technicians had a lower risk (IRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-0.99) than individuals in the general population during the 2011-2022 study period. Male pharmacists had a higher risk of suicide than other males (IRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11-1.41) while female technicians had a higher risk than other females (IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.44) during the 2011-2022 study period. In terms of the features associated with suicide, compared to the general population, pharmacists had higher odds of preceding job problems, while pharmacy technicians had higher odds of mental health problems. Pharmacists also had higher odds of using poisoning as a method.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    Our findings suggest that pharmacists and female pharmacy technicians are at higher risk of suicide than their counterparts from the general population, possibly indicating that increased awareness and prevention are warranted.
