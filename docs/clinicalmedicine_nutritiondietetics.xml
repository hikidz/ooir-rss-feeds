Abstract: Background/Objectives: The complementary feeding period is a critical window for shaping infant diet, gut microbiota, and immune development. While allergic symptoms often emerge in the first year of life, the effects of specific foods, such fruits, on infant allergy symptoms, inflammation, immunity and associated microbiota remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of daily blueberry consumption during the complementary feeding period on allergy-related symptoms, immune biomarkers, and gut microbiota in breastfed U.S. infants. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, infants from the Denver metro area were assigned to receive up to 10 g/day of freeze-dried blueberry powder or an isocaloric placebo from 5 to 12 months of age. Stool, blood, and caregiver-reported allergy-related symptom data were collected at baseline and study end. Results: Of the 76 infants enrolled, 61 completed the study (Blueberry: n = 30; Placebo: n = 31). While more infants in the blueberry group had allergy-related symptoms at baseline, they had significantly different longitudinal symptom trajectories than the placebo (p = 0.05), showing a greater resolution rate of symptoms by study end. Pro-inflammatory serum IL-13 levels were significantly reduced (p = 0.035) and anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels borderline increased (p = 0.052) in the blueberry group. However, changes in allergy symptoms were not significantly associated with IL-10 or IL-13. The relative abundances of Lacticaseibacillus, Blautia, and Peptostreptococcaceae at 12 months were negatively correlated with IL-10, while Lactobacillus, Clostridiaceae, and Megasphaera were positively associated. IL-13 was positively associated with Citrobacter and negatively associated with Anaerostipes and Blautia. Conclusions: The consumptio9n of blueberries as an early complementary food may improve resolution of allergy symptoms, modulate immune biomarkers, and promote beneficial shifts in gut microbiota during infancy. Future research should aim to identify the specific bioactive components of blueberries responsible for these effects and explore the potential of other complementary foods to favorably influence developing biological systems involved in microbiota and immune development.

Abstract: IntroductionHuman breast milk is a sophisticated and complex biological fluid that provides crucial nutritional, immunological, and microbial benefits to infants. Hormones exhibit circadian variations in maternal serum, and understanding these fluctuations in breast milk is crucial for assessing infant maturation. This is particularly relevant when expressed breast milk is fed at a different time from when it was originally produced.MethodsThis study examined 24-h variations in breast milk composition by analyzing samples from 38 lactating mothers at four distinct times of the day. Levels of cortisol, melatonin, immunoglobulin A (IgA), lactoferrin, and oxytocin were quantified using ELISA, and microbiome composition was assessed through 16S rRNA sequencing.ResultsSignificant 24-h fluctuations in melatonin and cortisol concentrations were noted, whereas lactoferrin and IgA levels only varied when separating by infant age, maternal BMI, or infant sex. Breast milk microbial composition shifted, with a nocturnal increase in skin-associated bacteria and a diurnal increase in environmental bacteria depending on maternal BMI and infant age. Additionally, milk microbiota alpha diversity increased due to age, but not consistently over all the time points.DiscussionThese differences in 24-h breast milk composition underscore the physiological relevance of maintaining the natural temporal dynamics of breast milk, which may be disrupted when expressed breast milk is fed asynchronously from its time of expression.

Abstract: IntroductionComplementary feeding is a critical period marked by rapid changes in the infant’s diet, nutrient needs, and gut microbiota. However, the effects of specific foods introduced during complementary feeding, such as blueberries, on the developing infant gut microbiota remain unclear. Our primary aim was to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of freeze-dried blueberry powder during complementary feeding on gut microbiota development in U. S. human-milk-fed infants.MethodsIn a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled feeding trial, infants from the Denver metro area (Colorado, United States) were randomly assigned to consume up to 10 g of freeze-dried blueberry powder or an isocaloric placebo powder, combined with liquid or semi-liquid and served as a puree, daily from 5 to 12 months of age. Stool samples were collected bimonthly to assess gut microbial diversity and composition. Novel taxa were identified through parsimony insertion into the SILVA reference phylogenetic tree. Infant length, weight and dietary intakes were also assessed.ResultsSeventy-six caregiver-infant pairs consented and enrolled in the study and 61 completed the study (blueberry group n = 30, placebo group n = 31). There were no differences between groups in energy or macronutrient intakes from complementary foods. Growth z-scores were comparable between groups. Gut microbiota alpha diversity increased over time in both groups (effect of time p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Several taxa, including Veillonaceae, Flavonifractor, Subdoligranulum, and Butryicicoccus (all more abundant in the blueberry group), and Actinomyces, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and Romboutsia (more abundant in the placebo group) had group-by-time interactions that trended toward significance.ConclusionIntroducing blueberries as one of the first complementary foods, in the form of freeze-dried powder served as a puree, exerts potential benefits in gut microbiota development and maturation in this cohort of human-milk-fed infants.Systematic review registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05006989.
