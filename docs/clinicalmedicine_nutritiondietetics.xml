Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            While daily step count and stepping pace are linked to various health benefits in older adults, less is known about how the pattern of step accumulation affects physical function. For example, the same step count could be accumulated through clusters of frequent, short bouts (e.g., during house cleaning) or fewer, longer bouts (e.g., walking to and from work). This study aimed to explore whether stepping patterns, and trends in these patterns, were associated with physical function in older adults.
          
          
            Methods
            We analysed accelerometer data from wrist-worn GENEActiv devices, from four time points over 24 months in n = 597 older adults (age ≥65 years, 68% female) participating in the REtirement in ACTion intervention. A step counting algorithm was used to create bouts of stepping (at least 10 steps &amp;gt; 20 steps/minute) before counting the steps in each bout and the average cadence. Total daily steps (20–175 steps/minute), slower-paced steps (20–62 steps/minute; below the median cadence), and faster-paced walking steps (63–175 steps/minute; above the median cadence) were then calculated. We used the frequency of stepping bouts, the time between them (mean and standard deviation) and their burstiness (short bursts of stepping bouts clustered together), to examine the daily patterns of step accumulation. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess trends in stepping variables and their association with changes in objectively measured physical function (short physical performance battery: SPPB) over the two-year period.
          
          
            Results
            Total, slower-paced and faster-paced daily steps declined, along with the average number of stepping bouts. The time between stepping bouts increased. All components of burstiness, but not burstiness itself, were associated with changes in physical function, even when faster and slower steps (total steps) were in the same model (fewer stepping bouts = lower SPPB, greater SD = lower SPPB). Mean time between bouts was the strongest independent predictor, whereby a 10-minute increase in time between bouts was associated with a clinically important 0.46 decline in SPPB score (p &amp;lt; 0.001).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Preventing increases in the time between stepping bouts could help preserve physical function in older adults. Future intervention trials targeting how bouts of stepping are spread throughout the day, rather than just total steps, may provide a more effective approach to promoting healthy physical functioning in older age.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background/Objectives
            Sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and show clear differential metabolic responses compared with 100% fruit juice, which is unsweetened by law. This study investigated whether the postprandial glycaemic response following a standardized breakfast differed when accompanied by 100% orange juice, equivalent whole orange, or a sugar-sweetened control beverage in individuals with well-controlled T2DM.
          
          
            Subjects/Methods
            Fifteen individuals with T2DM (60 ± 6 y; BMI 28.7 ± 5.0 kg/m², HbA1C 49 ± 3 mmol/mol (6.6 ± 0.3%)) participated in this randomized cross-over trial. They consumed a standardized breakfast served with either 250 mL of 100% orange juice, a sugar-sweetened orange-flavoured beverage or whole orange pieces with identical total sugar content. Postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were checked during 4 h.
          
          
            Results
            Following a single intake, no significant differences were found in acute glucose or insulin responses (expressed as total or incremental area under the curve or peak values; p
              treatment &amp;gt; 0.05, respectively) when either whole orange pieces, orange juice or a sugar-sweetened control beverage were consumed with a standard high carbohydrate meal. Capillary glucose responses did not differ between conditions (p
              treatment &amp;gt; 0.05).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Acute glycaemic control in individuals with well-controlled T2DM is not significantly influenced by serving orange juice, whole orange pieces or a sugar-sweetened beverage with a standard high-carbohydrate meal.
