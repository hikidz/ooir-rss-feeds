Abstract: AbstractObjectiveWe examined whether meal timing is associated with long‐term weight‐loss maintenance and whether meal timing interacts with a genome‐wide polygenic score (PRS‐BMI) on body weight‐related outcomes. We then examined the interaction of meal timing with 97 BMI‐related single‐nucleotide polymorphisms on obesity outcome.MethodsParticipants (N = 1195, mean age 41.07 [SD 12.68] years, female 80.8%, baseline mean BMI 31.32 [SD 5.53] kg/m2) were adults with overweight or obesity from the Obesity, Nutrigenetics, Timing, and Mediterranean (ONTIME) study. We developed a PRS‐BMI to assess the genetic risk for obesity and estimated the timing of the midpoint of meal intake. We also calculated the success in long‐term weight‐loss maintenance after a dietary obesity treatment (at least 3 years). Linear regression analyses were performed for association and interaction assessments.ResultsEach hour of delay in meal timing was associated with 2.2% higher long‐term body weight (β [SE] = 2.177% [1.067%]; p = 0.042) (i.e., with lower weight‐loss maintenance following dietary obesity treatment). There was a significant interaction between meal timing and PRS‐BMI (p = 0.008); BMI increased by more than 2 kg/m2 for every hour of delay in meal timing in individuals with high PRS‐BMI (β [SE] = 2.208 [0.502] kg/m2; p = 1.0E‐5), whereas no associations were evident for those with lower genetic risk.ConclusionsMeal timing is associated with weight‐loss maintenance and may influence the association between obesity genetics and BMI. Findings underscore the importance of personalized obesity management.image

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            While daily step count and stepping pace are linked to various health benefits in older adults, less is known about how the pattern of step accumulation affects physical function. For example, the same step count could be accumulated through clusters of frequent, short bouts (e.g., during house cleaning) or fewer, longer bouts (e.g., walking to and from work). This study aimed to explore whether stepping patterns, and trends in these patterns, were associated with physical function in older adults.
          
          
            Methods
            We analysed accelerometer data from wrist-worn GENEActiv devices, from four time points over 24 months in n = 597 older adults (age ≥65 years, 68% female) participating in the REtirement in ACTion intervention. A step counting algorithm was used to create bouts of stepping (at least 10 steps &amp;gt; 20 steps/minute) before counting the steps in each bout and the average cadence. Total daily steps (20–175 steps/minute), slower-paced steps (20–62 steps/minute; below the median cadence), and faster-paced walking steps (63–175 steps/minute; above the median cadence) were then calculated. We used the frequency of stepping bouts, the time between them (mean and standard deviation) and their burstiness (short bursts of stepping bouts clustered together), to examine the daily patterns of step accumulation. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess trends in stepping variables and their association with changes in objectively measured physical function (short physical performance battery: SPPB) over the two-year period.
          
          
            Results
            Total, slower-paced and faster-paced daily steps declined, along with the average number of stepping bouts. The time between stepping bouts increased. All components of burstiness, but not burstiness itself, were associated with changes in physical function, even when faster and slower steps (total steps) were in the same model (fewer stepping bouts = lower SPPB, greater SD = lower SPPB). Mean time between bouts was the strongest independent predictor, whereby a 10-minute increase in time between bouts was associated with a clinically important 0.46 decline in SPPB score (p &amp;lt; 0.001).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Preventing increases in the time between stepping bouts could help preserve physical function in older adults. Future intervention trials targeting how bouts of stepping are spread throughout the day, rather than just total steps, may provide a more effective approach to promoting healthy physical functioning in older age.

Abstract: ABSTRACTObjectiveTo investigate the effect of krill oil (KO) supplementation during alternate‐day fasting (ADF) on body composition and muscle function in healthy adults with overweight.MethodsIn a randomized trial, during the 8‐week ADF, participants consumed four capsules per day containing krill oil (KO group) or vegetable oil (placebo group). Each capsule of KO contained 191 mg EPA, 94 mg DHA, 78 mg choline, and 100 mcg astaxanthin. Body mass, fat‐free mass (FFM), and handgrip strength (HGS) were measured before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using ANOVA.ResultsThe study was completed by 41 (25 women and 16 men) participants (age: 39 ± 10 years, BMI: 31.1 ± 4.2 kg/m2). Body weight reduction was not different (p &amp;gt; 0.05) between groups (KO, −4.6 ± 1.4 kg; Placebo, −4.5 ± 1.9 kg). The KO group had no change (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in FFM (−0.2 ± 0.9 kg) or HGS (−0.2 ± 0.5 kg). The placebo group experienced a reduction (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in FFM (−1.2 ± 2.0 kg) and HGS (−0.9 ± 0.7 kg). Changes in FFM and HGS were different (p &amp;lt; 0.05) between groups.ConclusionsKO supplementation during body weight loss attenuates the decline in FFM and muscle strength.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT06001632)
