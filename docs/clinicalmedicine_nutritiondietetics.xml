Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundCurrent clinical guidelines for chronic constipation offer limited dietary recommendations. The aim of this project was to develop the first comprehensive evidence‐based dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation in adults.MethodsFour systematic reviews and meta‐analyses were performed to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The findings generated from the meta‐analyses were then used to develop guideline statements using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and a Delphi consensus survey among a multi‐disciplinary expert Guideline Steering Committee. Recommendation statements were produced for treatment response, stool output, gut symptoms, adverse events, and quality of life, and only based on the findings where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the meta‐analysis. The strength of recommendation was assessed using the GRADE approach. Consensus voting amongst the Guideline Steering Committee was performed using a modified Delphi survey approach.ResultsThe four systematic reviews included a total of 75 RCTs. Fifty‐nine dietary recommendation statements were generated and accepted through the Delphi survey. For dietary supplements, 15 recommendation statements relate to fibre supplements, 20 relate to probiotics, 2 to synbiotics, 5 to magnesium oxide, 2 to senna, and 3 to kiwifruit supplements. For foods, three recommendation statements related to kiwifruits, two to prunes, and two to rye bread. For drinks, five recommendation statements related to high mineral‐containing water. No recommendations were made for whole diet approaches due to a lack of evidence. Twelve statements had a very low level of evidence, 39 had a low level of evidence, and 8 had moderate evidence. Twenty‐seven statements were strong recommendations, and 32 were qualified recommendations.ConclusionsThese are the first comprehensive evidence‐based dietary guidelines for the management of constipation based upon a robust systematic review and GRADE processes. Recommendations were made for dietary supplements, foods and drinks that have never been previously included in clinical guidelines, and can now be rapidly implemented into clinical practice, thereby improving clinical care and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Abstract
               
                  Context
                  Researchers have identified differences in metabolic activity between vitamins D2 and D3. Moreover, it is suspected from randomized controlled trial data that vitamin D2 supplementation increases the metabolic clearance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], but this effect has yet to be quantified.
               
               
                  Objective
                  This study sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of vitamin D2 supplementation on serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations.
               
               
                  Data Sources
                  PUBMED was searched for articles published from January 1, 1975, to February 1, 2023. Of the 202 articles retrieved, 20 were included in this review, and of those, 11 were suitable for meta-analysis.
               
               
                  Data Extraction
                  Randomized controlled trials reporting either baseline and postintervention serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations (nmol/L) or absolute changes in concentrations were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were calculated using Review Manager (version 5.3; The Cochrane Collaboration). Mean differences were reported with 95% CIs.
               
               
                  Data Analysis
                  In meta-analyses there was a reduction in serum 25(OH)D3 after vitamin D2 supplementation compared with control for end-of-trial between-groups data (random weighted mean difference [WMD] = −17.99 nmol/L; 95% CI, −25.86 to −10.12; P &amp;amp;lt; .00001) and absolute change over the trial (random WMD = −9.25 nmol/L; 95% CI, −14.40 to −4.10; P = .0004).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Study participants who received vitamin D2 supplementation showed statistically significant reductions in serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations, compared to controls without supplementation. An inverse relationship between vitamin D2 and D3 concentrations has been proposed in the literature. A regulatory mechanism that increases the disposal rate of 25(OH)D after an increase in vitamin D concentrations could explain these results. However, further research is needed to establish whether vitamins D2 and D3 elicit different changes in overall vitamin D metabolism that might influence clinical advice to recommend vitamin D3 supplements over vitamin D2 supplements, where appropriate.

Abstract: Abstract
	  This study examined the associations between cold and hot food and beverage consumption and various health outcomes among Asians and Whites in the USA. Data were drawn from 212 Asian and 203 White adults (aged 18–65 years) in the Healthy Ageing Survey. Participants reported their frequency of cold and hot drink and meal intake, along with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and gastrointestinal issues (e.g. gas, abdominal fullness). Multivariable analyses adjusted for confounders were used to assess these associations. Among Asians, higher cold consumption in summer was associated with increased anxiety (β = 0·24, 95 % CI: 0·05, 0·44) and abdominal fullness (β = 0·05, 95 % CI: 0·01, 0·86). In contrast, among Whites, higher winter hot drink intake was linked to lower insomnia (β = –0·23, 95 % CI: –0·42, –0·04) and gas symptoms (β = –0·05, 95 % CI: –0·09, –0·01). Tertile analyses showed that, compared with tertile 1, Asians in the highest tertile of summer cold drink intake had higher insomnia scores (β = 1·26, 95 % CI: 0·19, 2·33), while Whites in the highest tertile of winter hot drink intake had lower depression scores (β = –1·73, 95 % CI: –3·28, –0·18). These associations were stronger among individuals with cold hands but not observed in those without. Findings suggest that the temperature of foods and beverages may influence mental and gut health, underscoring the need to consider temperature-related dietary habits in public health and nutrition strategies, particularly across diverse populations.

Abstract: Abstract
	  Previous studies highlighted the health benefits of coffee and tea, but they only focused on the comparisons between different consumptions. Consequently, the association estimate lacked a clear interpretation, as the substitution of beverages and distribution of doses were not explicitly prescribed. We focused on the ‘relative association’ to ascertain the optimal consumption strategy (including total intake and optimal allocation strategy) for coffee, tea and plain water associated with decreased mortality. Self-reported coffee, tea and plain water intake were used from the UK Biobank. Within a compositional data analysis framework, a multivariate Cox model was used to assess the relative associations after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. The lower mortality risk was observed with at least approximately 7–8 drinks/d of total consumption. When the total intake &amp;gt; 4 drinks/d, substituting plain water with coffee or tea was linked to reduced mortality; nevertheless, the benefit was not seen for ≤ 4 drinks/d. Besides, a balanced consumption of coffee and tea (roughly a ratio of 2:3) associated with the lowest hazard ratios of 0·55 (95 % CI 0·47, 0·64) for all-cause mortality, 0·59 (95 % CI 0·48, 0·72) for cancer mortality, 0·69 (95 % CI 0·49, 0·99) for CVD mortality, 0·28 (95 % CI 0·15, 0·52) for respiratory disease mortality and 0·35 (95 % CI 0·15, 0·82) for digestive disease mortality than other combinations. These results highlight the importance of the rational combination of coffee, tea and plain water, with particular emphasis on ensuring adequate total intake, offering more comprehensive and explicit guidance for individuals.
