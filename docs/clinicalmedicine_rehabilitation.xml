Abstract: 
            Purpose:
            Residual speech sound disorder (RSSD) is a high-prevalence condition that can limit children's academic and social participation, with negative consequences for overall well-being. Previous studies have described visual biofeedback as a promising option for RSSD, but results have been inconclusive due to study design limitations and small sample sizes.
          
          
            Method:
            In a preregistered randomized controlled trial, 108 children aged 9–15 years with RSSD affecting American English /ɹ/ were randomly assigned to receive treatment incorporating visual biofeedback (subdivided into ultrasound and visual-acoustic types) or a comparison condition of motor-based treatment consistent with current best practices in speech therapy. An acoustic measure (the distance between the second and third formants, which is smaller in perceptually accurate /ɹ/) was used to quantify progress in the first three sessions of treatment in participants' assigned condition. The focus on the early stages of treatment was grounded in principles of motor learning: As a type of knowledge of performance feedback, biofeedback is expected to have its greatest impact during initial acquisition of a new speech-motor plan.
          
          
            Results:
            A linear mixed-effects regression model revealed a statistically significant interaction between treatment type and session: While both groups made progress over time, the rate of progress was significantly faster in the biofeedback condition compared to motor-based treatment. No statistically significant difference was observed between the ultrasound and visual-acoustic types of biofeedback.
          
          
            Discussion:
            This large-scale randomized controlled trial supports previous small-scale research in finding that biofeedback can help children with RSSD acquire American English /ɹ/. A companion study will compare participants' generalization learning after the end of all treatment.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            A lack of evidence of compelling clinical benefits is a key factor limiting the adoption of commercialized powered robotic knee prostheses into mainstream clinical practice. Previous studies have demonstrated mixed results, potentially due to a combination of limitations in prosthetic hardware, control algorithms, and testing methodologies.
          
          
            Methods
            We investigated the clinical effects of a commercialized robotic knee prosthesis (the latest generation Össur Power KneeTM) with n=7 above-knee amputee participants. Participants with both higher (K4) and lower mobility (K3) completed a series of experiments including repeated sitting and standing, a stand, walk, sit shuttle test, and fast walking on a treadmill. We tested both standard (ÖSSR) and novel (HKIC) control policies and compared the resulting clinical metrics to those found with the users’ prescribed passive prostheses. Our experiments were physically demanding, which could help elucidate the potential benefits of powered knees.
          
          
            Results
            The clinical effects of the Power Knee varied with mobility level and the control policy used. The phase-based controller often produced stronger walking and sit/stand improvements for the higher mobility group compared to the default controller, though it also presented a steeper learning curve and reduced walk-to-sit transition speed. Conversely, the default control policy was perceived as easier to master but was less assistive to the higher mobility group and produced slower sit/stand cycles. Lower mobility participants experienced improvements in standing speed (HKIC: 
                $$36.7\pm 15.1$$
              % faster, 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ; ÖSSR: 
                $$28.8\pm 15.1$$
              % faster, 
                $$p=0.001$$
              ), inter-limb ground reaction force symmetry (HKIC: 
                $$-0.214\pm 0.068$$
              , 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ; ÖSSR: 
                $$-0.199\pm 0.068$$
              , 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ), and inter-limb peak knee moment symmetry (HKIC: 
                $$-0.290\pm 0.126$$
              , 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ; ÖSSR: 
                $$-0.284\pm 0.126$$
              , 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ) during sit-to-stand tasks relative to their passive prostheses. In contrast, higher mobility participants benefited less in sit/stand but showed improvements while walking including increased toe clearance (HKIC: 
                $$25.4\pm 12.2$$
               mm, 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ; ÖSSR: 
                $$13.4\pm 12.2$$
               mm, 
                $$p=0.033$$
              ), greater early stance knee flexion (HKIC: 
                $$7.1\pm 2.9^\circ $$
              , 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ; ÖSSR: 
                $$4.5\pm 2.9^\circ $$
              , 
                $$p=0.005$$
              ), and, for the HKIC policy, a reduced swing-phase peak hip flexion moment (HKIC: 
                $$-0.18\pm 0.11$$
               Nm/kg/(m/s), 
                $$p=0.003$$
              ). Despite these biomechanical improvements and qualitative reports of reduced effort, neither control policy produced significant benefits in endurance or repeated task performance compared to the passive condition. Sit-to-stand cycle count in the lower mobility group was unchanged (HKIC: 
                $$p=0.268$$
              , ÖSSR: 
                $$p=0.848$$
              ), and it was reduced in the higher mobility group with the ÖSSR condition (
                $$2.0\pm 1.4$$
               fewer, 
                $$p=0.007$$
              ). In the shuttle walk test, laps completed by higher mobility users decreased with HKIC (
                $$157.3\pm 46.3$$
               fewer, 
                $$p&amp;lt;0.001$$
              ), and no significant differences were found for lower mobility users. No significant changes in fast walking distance or speed were observed across conditions.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The latest generation Power Knee can create clinical improvements in walking and sit/stand behaviors compared to passive (microprocessor) knees, though the effects are sensitive to the user’s mobility level and the Power Knee’s control policy. However, these improvements did not directly translate to improved functional performance or endurance. Some negative effects of the Power Knee were also observed including reduced agility, slower transitions, and thermal limitations, though some of these limitations could potentially be addressed through future control innovations or with more thorough acclimation. The observed benefits motivate future longitudinal studies to investigate the clinical effects of robotic knees compared to passive (microprocessor) knees in real-world settings and to elucidate how they could be best utilized in clinical practice.

Abstract:  SYNOPSIS: Pain near the posteromedial tibia is common in running and jumping athletes. This problem has had many names, with “shin splints” and “medial tibial stress syndrome” (MTSS) the most common. The term shin splints is nonspecific and nondescript, and has never gained clinical traction. Similarly, the clinical use of MTSS with athletes and coaches is often met with confusion as “tibial stress” is frequently misinterpreted as indicating a bone stress injury. With no conclusive evidence regarding the pathophysiology of MTSS, we advocate renaming it “Load Induced Medial-Leg Pain” (LIMP). LIMP avoids the use of “tibial stress,” which is problematic due to the unknown pathology of the condition and its confusion with bone stress injury. Using the term LIMP instead of MTSS gives clinicians, researchers, and athletes a clearer, more accurate way to approach managing exercise-related lower leg pain.
