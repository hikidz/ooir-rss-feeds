Abstract: Abstract
          Lumbar spinal stenosis is a growing problem among older adults, associated with significant disability and socio-economic burden. Neurogenic claudication is the most common clinical syndrome caused by LSS with pain being the predominant symptom and limited walking the main impairment. Lumbar spinal stenosis can also impact sexual function in older adults, necessitating greater awareness of this association. Pain and impaired function can lead to psychosocial distress, including hopelessness, anxiety, and isolation, further compounding disability. Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend non-operative treatment as the first-line approach, including manual therapy, exercise, and education. However, these guidelines lack details on the practical application of these interventions in clinical practice. This narrative review explores the epidemiology of lumbar spinal stenosis, the evidence supporting non-operative care, and practical management strategies. It also highlights the relationship between sexual dysfunction and lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of painful versus nonpainful exercise on pain, disability, and other patient-reported outcomes in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain.  DESIGN: This study is an intervention systematic review with meta-analysis.  LITERATURE SEARCH: Electronic databases (CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO) and trial registers ( ClinicalTrials.gov , ANZCTR, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched from October 2016 to May 2024.  STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that compared painful exercise to nonpainful exercise in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB2 tool and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations framework.  RESULTS: We included 16 trials (reported across 18 studies). There was no difference in the effect of painful versus nonpainful exercise on pain intensity or disability in the short, medium, or long term or pain catastrophizing or fear avoidance in the short term. The confidence intervals were wide. Narrative synthesis found similar results for quality of life, self-efficacy, mood, and adverse events. All trials were at high risk of bias, and certainty of evidence was very low to low.  CONCLUSION: The effect of painful versus nonpainful exercise on patient-reported outcomes in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain was unclear. Pain during exercise may not need to be avoided to allow for symptomatic and functional improvement. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2025;55(8):527-537.

Abstract: 
            Purpose:
            The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship between infant vocal characteristics and later speech motor impairment in children at risk for cerebral palsy (CP) to inform the early prediction of speech motor impairment.
          
          
            Method:
            Vocal complexity, volubility, and consonant inventories of 13 infants at risk of CP were examined at approximately 12 months. We examined their association with later levels of speech motor impairment as measured by the Viking Speech Scale (VSS).
          
          
            Results:
            Children in our sample with greater speech motor impairment at age 4 years produced lower rates of developmentally complex vocalizations in infancy but showed no significant differences in vocal stage attainment, volubility, or consonant diversity.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Our results are in line with trends found in prior literature examining vocal characteristics of infants at risk for speech motor involvement. These results can inform data-driven hypotheses in future studies aimed at the early prediction of speech motor impairment through the study of infant vocal production.
