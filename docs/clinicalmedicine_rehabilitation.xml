Abstract: 
            Introduction:
            Emerging research associates long COVID with the ocular system, including vision difficulties. This study determines the association of long COVID with vision difficulties among U.S. adults.
            Methods:
            We used a cross-sectional observational study design of 2022 Census Household Pulse Survey adult data (
            N
             = 51,288). COVID status was defined as follows: “long COVID”: those with new symptoms 3 months or longer after COVID infection; “short-term COVID”: those who had COVID but no long COVID symptoms; and “no COVID”: those who have never had COVID. The vision categories were suggested by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning: no difficulty, some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, and cannot do at all. Rao-Scott Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression (adjusted for COVID status, sex, age, race and ethnicity, marital status, poverty, education, food insecurity, health insurance, region, remote work, COVID vaccine, depression, and anxiety), with replicate weights were used.
            Results:
            The study included 51,288 respondents. There were 31.3% who had some vision difficulty, and 4.2% had a lot of difficulty or were unable to see. The proportion who reported that they had long COVID was 14.4%. A higher percentage of adults with long COVID reported vision difficulties than those without COVID (47.6% vs. 31.9%). Adults with long COVID had greater odds of reporting a lot of difficulty or cannot do at all (AOR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.19, 1.81) and some difficulty seeing (AOR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.27, 1.70) compared to adults without COVID. We did not observe a statistically significant association of short-term COVID with vision difficulties compared to adults without COVID.
            Discussion:
            One in seven U.S. adults had long COVID. Adults with long COVID had higher odds of vision difficulties than those without COVID. Further research is needed on long COVID and vision difficulties and subsequent vision care.
            Implications for Practitioners:
            A follow-up study of patients with long COVID needs to include screening for vision difficulties.

Abstract: 
            Objective:
            Military service over the last several decades has been associated with an increased risk of injuries, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Veterans with a history of TBI often experience poor health outcomes and have higher rates of premature mortality. In this study, we examined whether accelerated biological aging could help explain negative health outcomes following TBI.
          
          
            Setting, participants, and design:
            We evaluated the association between TBI and rate of epigenetic aging (assessed using DunedinPACE) using data from post-9/11 veterans (N = 1152) enrolled in the VA Mid-Atlantic (VISN 6) MIRECC Post-Deployment Mental Health cohort study.
          
          
            Main measures:
            TBI was assessed using self-report during a clinical interview categorized into three TBI groups (none, 1, 2 +), epigenetic aging was assessed using DunedinPACE derived from DNA methylation data.
          
          
            Results:
            Veterans who reported more lifetime TBI (β = 0.07, 95% CI [0.01, 0.14], P = .029) or deployment-related TBI (β = 0.09, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18], P = .046) had faster epigenetic aging. TBI during and after military service was more strongly associated with accelerated aging than TBI prior to military service, and deployment-related TBI was more strongly associated with accelerated aging for women veterans. Overall, associations were small to moderate in size.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            These findings show TBI could increase risk for accelerated aging and underscores its potential utility in identifying veterans who may face aging-related health issues. Early identification of TBI-related accelerated aging could inform interventions that mitigate long-term health risks as post-9/11 veterans transition into middle and older age.

Abstract:  Identification of pain descriptors provide a plausible method to consider personalisation of management of pain based on presumed underlying mechanisms. The aim is to use mechanistic pain descriptors (nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic pain) to guide clinical practice into an era of personalised medicine for people with pain. Clinicians should understand the concept of descriptors to improve their understanding of a mechanism-based management of chronic pain. Nonetheless, all treatment of individuals suffering from chronic pain should be holistic (i.e., person-centred). Nociplastic pain already serves as an evidence-based explanation that can help make sense of pain without any known pathology, but is not ready to be considered as a target for treatment in itself, based on the current level of evidence. To summarise, treatment outcomes may benefit when treatments are matched to patients according to mechanistic descriptors, and current research initiatives are working on bring this closer to the clinic.
