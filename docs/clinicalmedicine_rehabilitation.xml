Abstract:  Identification of pain descriptors provide a plausible method to consider personalisation of management of pain based on presumed underlying mechanisms. The aim is to use mechanistic pain descriptors (nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic pain) to guide clinical practice into an era of personalised medicine for people with pain. Clinicians should understand the concept of descriptors to improve their understanding of a mechanism-based management of chronic pain. Nonetheless, all treatment of individuals suffering from chronic pain should be holistic (i.e., person-centred). Nociplastic pain already serves as an evidence-based explanation that can help make sense of pain without any known pathology, but is not ready to be considered as a target for treatment in itself, based on the current level of evidence. To summarise, treatment outcomes may benefit when treatments are matched to patients according to mechanistic descriptors, and current research initiatives are working on bring this closer to the clinic.

Abstract: 
            Purpose:
            The diagnosis and treatment of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) remains a clinical challenge for many speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Given this, it is imperative to understand how SLPs learn about CAS during graduate school and throughout their careers.
          
          
            Method:
            In the current study, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association–certified SLPs who practice in the United States and work with young children completed a 32-item online survey. Survey items aimed to understand SLPs' experiences learning about CAS during graduate school and through continuing education (CE). Respondents were evaluated on their knowledge of diagnosing and treating CAS (against an expert consensus). Finally, the survey sought to investigate how respondents' learning experiences related to their knowledge of diagnosing and treating CAS.
          
          
            Results:
            
              In total, 346 clinicians completed the survey. Reliance on CE (
              p
              &amp;lt; .001) and scientific literature in SLP (
              p
              &amp;lt; .01) were found to be the only positive significant predictors of CAS knowledge. No graduate school experiences positively predicted CAS knowledge. The majority of clinicians indicated being unprepared to diagnose and treat CAS based on their graduate-level education but reported high levels of satisfaction for CE resources for CAS.
            
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Results of this study highlight challenges in graduate program models for training on CAS. Implications for graduate program models are discussed.

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundChildren with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience disparities in mental health care despite experiencing increased exposure to trauma such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Studies have suggested that the exclusion of people with ID from medical research may contribute to disparities in health care. It is currently unknown to what extent children with ID are excluded from trauma treatment research.MethodsAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 62) included in the most up‐to‐date International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) clinical care guidelines meta‐analysis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments were reanalysed and coded to determine whether or not children with ID or other developmental disabilities that co‐occur with ID were excluded based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Articles were double‐coded by the research team. The corresponding authors of the studies were asked to complete a survey rating the likelihood that children with ID would have been eligible for the study.ResultsOf the studies, 61.3% reviewed reported exclusion criteria based on a diagnosis of intellectual disability, cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, organic/neurological conditions, or other related terms (e.g., ‘significant learning difficulties’). Operationalisation of exclusion criteria was sparse. Few studies reported the number of children excluded from trials based on an ID diagnosis.ConclusionsThe evidence base for the ISTSS clinical care guidelines of child PTSD treatment is not representative of children with ID. Improved documentation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, reporting of disability as a demographic characteristic, and inclusion of children with ID in PTSD treatment trials are needed to improve representation of children with ID in PTSD research.
