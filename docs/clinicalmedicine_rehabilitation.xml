Abstract: 
            Purpose:
            Residual speech sound disorder (RSSD) is a high-prevalence condition that can limit children's academic and social participation, with negative consequences for overall well-being. Previous studies have described visual biofeedback as a promising option for RSSD, but results have been inconclusive due to study design limitations and small sample sizes.
          
          
            Method:
            In a preregistered randomized controlled trial, 108 children aged 9–15 years with RSSD affecting American English /ɹ/ were randomly assigned to receive treatment incorporating visual biofeedback (subdivided into ultrasound and visual-acoustic types) or a comparison condition of motor-based treatment consistent with current best practices in speech therapy. An acoustic measure (the distance between the second and third formants, which is smaller in perceptually accurate /ɹ/) was used to quantify progress in the first three sessions of treatment in participants' assigned condition. The focus on the early stages of treatment was grounded in principles of motor learning: As a type of knowledge of performance feedback, biofeedback is expected to have its greatest impact during initial acquisition of a new speech-motor plan.
          
          
            Results:
            A linear mixed-effects regression model revealed a statistically significant interaction between treatment type and session: While both groups made progress over time, the rate of progress was significantly faster in the biofeedback condition compared to motor-based treatment. No statistically significant difference was observed between the ultrasound and visual-acoustic types of biofeedback.
          
          
            Discussion:
            This large-scale randomized controlled trial supports previous small-scale research in finding that biofeedback can help children with RSSD acquire American English /ɹ/. A companion study will compare participants' generalization learning after the end of all treatment.

Abstract: 
            Spelling is a vital academic skill that supports students’ writing and reading development (Kim, 2020). We conducted a comprehensive meta-analytic review of spelling interventions with students with or at-risk for learning disabilities (LDs) employing randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, and single-case designs. Fifty-nine studies met inclusion criteria—39 group design and 20 single-case design (SCD) studies—comprising 2,229 students in Grades K–9, the vast majority of whom were described as with or at-risk for LDs, with only one study including general education students. The studies yielded 327 spelling and word reading effect sizes that were used to answer three research questions regarding the overall average impact of the interventions on spelling and word reading outcomes, differential effects of the spelling intervention approach, and characteristics that may moderate effects. We ran four meta-analytic models on spelling interventions’ effects on spelling and reading outcomes, conducted subgroup analyses on group designs for different spelling approaches, and ran meta-regression models with five covariates on group designs to examine moderating effects. Publication bias analyses were also conducted. Results indicated that group design spelling interventions had a small but significant effect on spelling (
            g
            = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.26, 0.40]) and word reading (
            g
            = 0.25, 95% CI = [0.13, 0.37]) outcomes, while SCDs had a large and significant impact on spelling (between-case standardized mean difference [BC-SMD]
            =
            2.47, 95% CI = [1.82, 3.13]) and word reading (BC-SMD = 1.52, 95% CI = [0.83, 2.21]) outcomes. Furthermore, results demonstrate that group design spelling interventions employing whole word study (
            g
            = 0.56, 95% CI = [0.41, 0.71]) and multilinguistic (
            g
            = 0.43, 95% CI = [0.25, 0.60]) approaches benefit spelling outcomes, while phonemic approaches to spelling intervention transfer to word reading outcomes (
            g
            = 0.45, 95% CI = [0.35, 0.55]). Findings highlight the need for systematic replication of spelling interventions to further understand the impact on writing and reading outcomes for students with LD.

Abstract: Abstract
               
                  Importance
                  Understanding how tendon structure relates to disability improvement during exercise interventions in rotator cuff tendinopathy is essential for optimizing individualized treatment strategies.
               
               
                  Objective
                  The objectives of this study were to characterize changes in supraspinatus tendon thickness and internal architecture over an 8-week resistive exercise intervention and evaluate the relationship between these changes and patient-reported shoulder disability.
               
               
                  Design
                  This was a prospective longitudinal observational study.
               
               
                  Setting
                  The settings were a university-based research laboratory and virtual supervision in participants’ homes.
               
               
                  Participants
                  Forty-seven adults with unilateral rotator cuff tendinopathy were the study participants.
               
               
                  Intervention
                  The intervention was an 8-week progressive resistive exercise program, supervised twice weekly by a physical therapist.
               
               
                  Main Outcomes and Measures
                  Primary outcomes were the Pennsylvania Shoulder Score, supraspinatus tendon thickness, and internal tendon architecture assessed using the peak spatial frequency radius via ultrasound. Measurements were taken at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess changes and associations.
               
               
                  Results
                  Significant improvements from baseline were observed for the Pennsylvania Shoulder Score at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Tendon thickness decreased significantly; changes in internal tendon architecture were not significant. A decrease in tendon thickness was associated with an improved Pennsylvania Shoulder Score at 2 weeks but not at 4 and 8 weeks.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Reductions in tendon thickness were associated with improved shoulder outcomes within the first 2 weeks of the intervention. Internal tendon architecture remained unchanged over the intervention. These findings suggest that tendon variables included in this study may be relevant only early in the intervention and that other factors should be investigated across different times of the intervention.
