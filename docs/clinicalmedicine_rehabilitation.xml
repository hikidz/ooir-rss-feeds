Abstract: 
            Purpose:
            Residual speech sound disorder (RSSD) is a high-prevalence condition that can limit children's academic and social participation, with negative consequences for overall well-being. Previous studies have described visual biofeedback as a promising option for RSSD, but results have been inconclusive due to study design limitations and small sample sizes.
          
          
            Method:
            In a preregistered randomized controlled trial, 108 children aged 9–15 years with RSSD affecting American English /ɹ/ were randomly assigned to receive treatment incorporating visual biofeedback (subdivided into ultrasound and visual-acoustic types) or a comparison condition of motor-based treatment consistent with current best practices in speech therapy. An acoustic measure (the distance between the second and third formants, which is smaller in perceptually accurate /ɹ/) was used to quantify progress in the first three sessions of treatment in participants' assigned condition. The focus on the early stages of treatment was grounded in principles of motor learning: As a type of knowledge of performance feedback, biofeedback is expected to have its greatest impact during initial acquisition of a new speech-motor plan.
          
          
            Results:
            A linear mixed-effects regression model revealed a statistically significant interaction between treatment type and session: While both groups made progress over time, the rate of progress was significantly faster in the biofeedback condition compared to motor-based treatment. No statistically significant difference was observed between the ultrasound and visual-acoustic types of biofeedback.
          
          
            Discussion:
            This large-scale randomized controlled trial supports previous small-scale research in finding that biofeedback can help children with RSSD acquire American English /ɹ/. A companion study will compare participants' generalization learning after the end of all treatment.

Abstract:  SYNOPSIS: Pain near the posteromedial tibia is common in running and jumping athletes. This problem has had many names, with “shin splints” and “medial tibial stress syndrome” (MTSS) the most common. The term shin splints is nonspecific and nondescript, and has never gained clinical traction. Similarly, the clinical use of MTSS with athletes and coaches is often met with confusion as “tibial stress” is frequently misinterpreted as indicating a bone stress injury. With no conclusive evidence regarding the pathophysiology of MTSS, we advocate renaming it “Load Induced Medial-Leg Pain” (LIMP). LIMP avoids the use of “tibial stress,” which is problematic due to the unknown pathology of the condition and its confusion with bone stress injury. Using the term LIMP instead of MTSS gives clinicians, researchers, and athletes a clearer, more accurate way to approach managing exercise-related lower leg pain.
