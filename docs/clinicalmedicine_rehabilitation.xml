Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Importance
                    New care models promoting early access to physical therapy by reducing or eliminating co-pays are emerging. Few studies have compared health care use in these programs to other care pathways across musculoskeletal conditions.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    The objective of this study was to describe episode-level musculoskeletal health care use across different care pathway options, including a no-copay physical therapy program.
                  
                  
                    Design
                    This study was a descriptive retrospective analysis of claims data.
                  
                  
                    Setting and Participants
                    This study included health care beneficiaries of a self-insured employer with approximately 52,000 covered lives.
                  
                  
                    Interventions or Exposures
                    The study included musculoskeletal care episodes from October 2019 to September 2020 categorized as no copay physical therapy, traditional physical therapy, or other management.
                  
                  
                    Main Outcomes
                    Rates of surgery/injection, imaging, inpatient services, physician services, emergency services, physical therapy, and other services by episode type, overall and stratified by body region: upper extremity, lower extremity, and spine.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Of 9696 total episodes, 886 (9.1%) were no copay physical therapy, 1261 (13%) were traditional physical therapy, and 7549 (77.9%) were other management. No copay physical therapy episodes had lower imaging rates (38%) compared to traditional physical therapy (47%) and other management (45%) episodes. Inpatient services were similar for no copay (16%) and traditional (12%) physical therapy, both lower than other management episodes (23%). Physician services were higher in other management (100%) and traditional physical therapy (81%) episodes compared to no copay physical therapy episodes (43%). Surgery/injection rates were similar for no copay (11%) and traditional (8%) physical therapy, both lower than other management episodes (27%). Differences by pathway were more pronounced for extremity conditions than for spine conditions.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Rates of no copay program use were modest with those who used the program having lower rates of advanced imaging, injection, and surgery.
                  
                  
                    Relevance
                    Findings may be most relevant for employers, health systems, and payors planning resource allocation and benefit design for similar programs.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Purpose
            Neratinib is a pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. Diarrhea is the most commonly reported toxicity, with the majority experiencing at least some grade of diarrhea. The mechanisms behind neratinib-induced diarrhea are yet to be fully defined, but have been linked to gut microbiome changes, specifically decreased levels of the genera Blautia. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Blautia luti (B.luti) administered as a daily probiotic on neratinib-induced diarrhea, and its effects on the gut microbiome in a well-established rat model.
          
          
            Methods
            Female albino Wistar (AW) rats (n = 40) were randomly allocated to groups including; vehicle control (VC), neratinib alone, B.luti alone and neratinib + B.luti in different schedules (Pre, Pre &amp;amp; Post or Post). Daily oral gavage administration of B.luti (107CFU/ml) was given according to corresponding schedules, alongside a 28-day cycle of neratinib (50 mg/kg). Diarrhea was graded daily, and faecal samples collected for gut microbiome analysis at study end. Ileum and colon samples were collected for intestinal analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on faecal samples and H&amp;amp;E performed on intestinal tissue for injury evaluation.
          
          
            Results
            Grade 3 diarrhea was reduced in the Post group when compared to the neratinib alone group (p = 0.0122). No significant differences were seen in the tissue injury scores of the ileum or colon. There was no significant change in microbial composition with B.luti administration.
          
          
            Conclusion
            This study demonstrated that administration of B.luti supplementation, was effective in reducing neratinib-induced diarrhea severity when consumed concurrently. This administration schedule may have a protective role in the intestines through immunomodulation.
