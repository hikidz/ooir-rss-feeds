Abstract: AimsThe purpose of this study was to investigate the difference in the incidence of early postoperative periprosthetic femoral fracture (POPFF) between flat-tapered wedge and collared fully hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated femoral components performed through the direct anterior approach (DAA).MethodsThis was a retrospective comparative study of 4,511 primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs), including 1,842 flat-tapered wedge and 2,669 collared fully HA-coated components, conducted by a single surgeon at a single institution using the DAA from August 2009 to June 2023. Propensity score matching was used to control confounding factors related to POPFF. After matching, 1,804 cases were selected for each group, and the incidence of early POPFF was compared between the two implant designs. An early POPFF was defined as a periprosthetic fracture undetected intraoperatively and on immediate postoperative radiographs that occurred within 90 days. The incidence of intraoperative periprosthetic femoral fracture (IOPFF) was also evaluated and compared between the two groups.ResultsEarly POPFF was significantly less frequent in the collared fully HA-coated designs (0.11%; n = 2) than in the flat-tapered wedge designs (0.72%; n = 13; p = 0.007). Regarding the details of early POPFFs, the median time to fracture was ten days and an injury mechanism was absent in 73% (n = 11). According to the Vancouver classification, two were fracture type A(G) and one was A(L), while B1 and B2 fractures comprised 33% (n = 5) and 47% (n = 7), respectively. Treatment methods included conservative management in 33% (n = 5), osteosynthesis in 53% (n = 8), and revision surgery in 13% (n = 2). IOPFF was significantly more frequent in the collared fully HA-coated designs (3.49%; n = 63) than in the flat-tapered wedge designs (2.00%; n = 36; p = 0.008).ConclusionThe results of this large-scale, propensity score-matched study implied that the incidence of early POPFFs with collared fully HA-coated femoral components was lower than flat-tapered wedge designs. However, the incidence of IOPFFs was higher with collared fully HA-coated femoral components. These findings highlight the importance of femoral component design, including broaching, in THA implant selection for POPFF and IOPFF.Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2025;107-B(10):1011–1019.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
                  
                    Previous observations of multi‐echo ultrashort echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) decay data from the Achilles tendon (AT) report an off‐resonance non‐water signal associated with non‐collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. This cross‐sectional study investigates the relationship between this MRI‐derived tissue matrix signal and mechanical stiffness of the AT in professional ballet dancers and non‐dancer adults. Multiexponential analysis of multi‐echo UTE MRI was used to quantify water components and an off‐resonance AT matrix component. To compare AT structure with its functionality, shear wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound US was used to measure tendon stiffness along both longitudinal (V
                    L
                    ) and transverse (V
                    S
                    ) axes. 34 participants, including 15 ballet dancers and 19 non‐dancers, were studied. Dancers exhibited significantly larger V
                    S
                    (
                    p
                     = 0.013) compared to non‐dancers, consistent with prior observations of a training effect in tendon from repeated loading with exercise. UTE‐derived off‐resonance relaxation component amplitude, β
                    3
                    , was positively associated with V
                    L
                    in dancers (
                    p
                     = 0.029) and V
                    S
                    in non‐dancers (
                    p
                     = 0.024), suggesting a microstructural role of this matrix component. While additional work is needed to unambiguously assign this off‐resonance signal, these findings suggest its association with non‐collagenous ECM and show potential for combined use of UTE and SWE imaging to assess tendon structure‐function relationships and adaptations to mechanical loading in vivo.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Importance
                    New care models promoting early access to physical therapy by reducing or eliminating co-pays are emerging. Few studies have compared health care use in these programs to other care pathways across musculoskeletal conditions.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    The objective of this study was to describe episode-level musculoskeletal health care use across different care pathway options, including a no-copay physical therapy program.
                  
                  
                    Design
                    This study was a descriptive retrospective analysis of claims data.
                  
                  
                    Setting and Participants
                    This study included health care beneficiaries of a self-insured employer with approximately 52,000 covered lives.
                  
                  
                    Interventions or Exposures
                    The study included musculoskeletal care episodes from October 2019 to September 2020 categorized as no copay physical therapy, traditional physical therapy, or other management.
                  
                  
                    Main Outcomes
                    Rates of surgery/injection, imaging, inpatient services, physician services, emergency services, physical therapy, and other services by episode type, overall and stratified by body region: upper extremity, lower extremity, and spine.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Of 9696 total episodes, 886 (9.1%) were no copay physical therapy, 1261 (13%) were traditional physical therapy, and 7549 (77.9%) were other management. No copay physical therapy episodes had lower imaging rates (38%) compared to traditional physical therapy (47%) and other management (45%) episodes. Inpatient services were similar for no copay (16%) and traditional (12%) physical therapy, both lower than other management episodes (23%). Physician services were higher in other management (100%) and traditional physical therapy (81%) episodes compared to no copay physical therapy episodes (43%). Surgery/injection rates were similar for no copay (11%) and traditional (8%) physical therapy, both lower than other management episodes (27%). Differences by pathway were more pronounced for extremity conditions than for spine conditions.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    Rates of no copay program use were modest with those who used the program having lower rates of advanced imaging, injection, and surgery.
                  
                  
                    Relevance
                    Findings may be most relevant for employers, health systems, and payors planning resource allocation and benefit design for similar programs.
