Abstract:  SYNOPSIS: Pain near the posteromedial tibia is common in running and jumping athletes. This problem has had many names, with “shin splints” and “medial tibial stress syndrome” (MTSS) the most common. The term shin splints is nonspecific and nondescript, and has never gained clinical traction. Similarly, the clinical use of MTSS with athletes and coaches is often met with confusion as “tibial stress” is frequently misinterpreted as indicating a bone stress injury. With no conclusive evidence regarding the pathophysiology of MTSS, we advocate renaming it “Load Induced Medial-Leg Pain” (LIMP). LIMP avoids the use of “tibial stress,” which is problematic due to the unknown pathology of the condition and its confusion with bone stress injury. Using the term LIMP instead of MTSS gives clinicians, researchers, and athletes a clearer, more accurate way to approach managing exercise-related lower leg pain.

Abstract: 
            Background:
            Gluteus medius tears and atrophy cause lateral hip pain, limp, and functional impairment. We developed the “broken wing sign,” a novel physical examination test for detecting gluteus medius tendon tears and muscle degeneration. This study evaluated its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility against magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative findings.
          
          
            Methods:
            We prospectively examined 59 patients (75 hips; mean age, 69.5 ± 10.8 years; 48 women) with suspected hip abductor insufficiency. The broken wing sign was tested with patients prone, the knee flexed at 90°, and the hip actively extended. A positive sign involved ≥10° of compensatory external hip rotation, visible as an inward drift of the foot, indicating gluteus medius (and resulting internal rotation) weakness. MRI served as the reference standard for classifying gluteus medius integrity as no tear, partial, full-thickness, or massive. Fatty infiltration was graded (Goutallier grades 0 to 4), quantified, and analyzed for a correlation with the examination findings. Diagnostic accuracy metrics were calculated.
          
          
            Results:
            The broken wing sign demonstrated high accuracy (sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 80.0%; positive predictive value [PPV], 91.8%; negative predictive value, 61.5%; diagnostic odds ratio, 17.8). An external rotation threshold of ≥30° yielded 100% specificity and 100% PPV for a tear. The sign detected acute tears with no or minimal fatty infiltration (100% sensitivity for massive tears). The degree of the external rotation angle was strongly correlated with muscle atrophy with fatty infiltration, showing 88.0% sensitivity for Goutallier grade ≥3 and 100% sensitivity for grade 4.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            The broken wing sign is clinically useful for diagnosing gluteus medius tendon tears and muscle atrophy, particularly massive tears and advanced fatty degeneration. It effectively guides MRI utilization and surgical planning, serving as a valuable initial diagnostic tool in the clinical setting.
          
          
            Level of Evidence:
            Diagnostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

Abstract: 
            Study Design
            Retrospective Cohort Study.
          
          
            Objectives
            To assess the efficacy and compliance of early night-time bracing in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with curve magnitudes between the recently proposed early-intervention threshold (15°) and the traditional treatment threshold (25°) recommended by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS).
          
          
            Methods
            
              This dual-center retrospective study included 153 AIS patients (Risser 0-3, Cobb angle 15°-25°) treated with the Dresdner Night-Time Brace (DNTB) between 2002 and 2021. Patient demographics, patient compliance, and radiographic outcomes were analyzed. Treatment success was defined by curve stabilization or regression. Statistical analysis was performed with significance set at
              P
              &amp;lt; 0.05.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              The DNTB achieved a mean in-brace correction of 60.9%, moderately correlated with the initial Cobb angle. Compliance was high: 72.6% of patients were compliant, 15.0% partially compliant, and 12.4% non-compliant. The in-brace correction angle was associated with compliance but not with age, sex, or initial curve magnitude. Compliance significantly influenced outcomes (
              P
              &amp;lt; 0.05). Overall curve progression was 12.5%, but only 2.7% in compliant patients, compared to 30.4% and 47.4% in partially and non-compliant groups, respectively. Surgery was required in 10.5% of non-compliant cases.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            Early intervention with the DNTB is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mild AIS (15°-25°), with treatment success highly dependent on patient compliance. These findings underscore the importance of timely bracing and sustained compliance.
