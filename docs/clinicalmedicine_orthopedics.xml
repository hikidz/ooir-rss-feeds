Abstract:  SYNOPSIS: Pain near the posteromedial tibia is common in running and jumping athletes. This problem has had many names, with “shin splints” and “medial tibial stress syndrome” (MTSS) the most common. The term shin splints is nonspecific and nondescript, and has never gained clinical traction. Similarly, the clinical use of MTSS with athletes and coaches is often met with confusion as “tibial stress” is frequently misinterpreted as indicating a bone stress injury. With no conclusive evidence regarding the pathophysiology of MTSS, we advocate renaming it “Load Induced Medial-Leg Pain” (LIMP). LIMP avoids the use of “tibial stress,” which is problematic due to the unknown pathology of the condition and its confusion with bone stress injury. Using the term LIMP instead of MTSS gives clinicians, researchers, and athletes a clearer, more accurate way to approach managing exercise-related lower leg pain.

Abstract: AbstractPurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the success rate of a standardised protocol for managing persistent wound drainage following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted at four institutions between January and June 2022 across primary and revision TKAs. Sixty‐two patients (mean age 71.5 ± 9.3 years; 45.2% male) who experienced postoperative wound drainage after primary (58.1%) or revision (41.9%) TKA were enrolled. The protocol included staged interventions: anticoagulation adjustments and dressing changes during Days 1–3, incisional negative pressure wound therapy during Days 3–5, and wound debridement above the joint capsule if drainage persisted beyond Day 7. Outcomes were evaluated using the ASEPSIS score. The primary outcome was defined as complete wound healing without progression to debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) procedure or periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).ResultsThe mean follow‐up was 13.2 months (range, 11.7–15.1 months). The protocol achieved a 91.9% success rate in preventing progression to DAIR. The median number of visits required to achieve wound healing was 3.5 for the cohort. DAIR rate was 8.1% (n = 5), while PJI rate was 1.6% (n = 1). Primary TKA procedures demonstrated more efficient healing trajectories compared to revision cases, requiring fewer clinical visits (median 3 vs. 5, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and shorter hospital stays (mean 4.5 vs. 7.5 days, p = 0.017). Cox proportional hazards model identified intervention type (revision vs. primary, hazard ratio [HR] 0.24, p &amp;lt; 0.001), advanced age (HR: 0.95 per year, p = 0.006), and male gender (HR: 0.45, p = 0.020) as significant independent predictors of increased time required to achieve wound healing.ConclusionOur standardised wound management protocol achieved a high success rate in preventing progression to PJI following TKA. The time‐dependent approach to intervention escalation provides clear clinical decision‐making criteria and suggests that early identification and systematic management of wound complications are critical determinants of successful outcomes, particularly for primary TKA procedures.Level of EvidenceLevel II.

Abstract: 
            Study Design
            Retrospective Cohort Study.
          
          
            Objectives
            To assess the efficacy and compliance of early night-time bracing in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with curve magnitudes between the recently proposed early-intervention threshold (15°) and the traditional treatment threshold (25°) recommended by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS).
          
          
            Methods
            
              This dual-center retrospective study included 153 AIS patients (Risser 0-3, Cobb angle 15°-25°) treated with the Dresdner Night-Time Brace (DNTB) between 2002 and 2021. Patient demographics, patient compliance, and radiographic outcomes were analyzed. Treatment success was defined by curve stabilization or regression. Statistical analysis was performed with significance set at
              P
              &amp;lt; 0.05.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              The DNTB achieved a mean in-brace correction of 60.9%, moderately correlated with the initial Cobb angle. Compliance was high: 72.6% of patients were compliant, 15.0% partially compliant, and 12.4% non-compliant. The in-brace correction angle was associated with compliance but not with age, sex, or initial curve magnitude. Compliance significantly influenced outcomes (
              P
              &amp;lt; 0.05). Overall curve progression was 12.5%, but only 2.7% in compliant patients, compared to 30.4% and 47.4% in partially and non-compliant groups, respectively. Surgery was required in 10.5% of non-compliant cases.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            Early intervention with the DNTB is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for mild AIS (15°-25°), with treatment success highly dependent on patient compliance. These findings underscore the importance of timely bracing and sustained compliance.

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic patient education delivered by a health care provider, either alone or in combination with other rehabilitation interventions, for reducing pain and disability in adults with subacute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions.  DESIGN: Intervention systematic review with meta-analysis.  LITERATURE SEARCH: Five databases were searched from 2005 to 2025.  STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic patient education in adults with subacute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions, compared to other interventions such as exercise programs. Outcomes included pain, disability, quality of life, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Treatment effects were estimated using random-effects models with standardized mean differences. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.  RESULTS: Sixty-nine RCTs were included, and 56 contributed data to meta-analyses (n = 6773 participants; mean age, 43.1 ± 10.3 years; 63% female). Adding therapeutic patient education to other interventions likely reduced pain, disability, and catastrophizing in the short term (moderate-certainty evidence), may reduce pain and disability in the medium term (low-certainty evidence), and likely resulted in a large reduction in kinesiophobia in the short and medium terms (moderate-certainty evidence). The efficacy of therapeutic patient education as a stand-alone intervention was uncertain.  CONCLUSION: Evidence supports using therapeutic patient education, in combination with other rehabilitation interventions, to reduce pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing in adults with subacute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions. The magnitude of the effects may vary from small to large. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2025;55(10):623-648. Epub 20 August 2025. doi:10.2519/jospt.2025.13247
