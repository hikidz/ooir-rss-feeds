Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Background
                    In today’s digital era, the internet plays a pervasive role in daily life, influencing everyday activities such as communication, work, and leisure. This online engagement intertwines with offline experiences, shaping individuals’ overall well-being. Despite its significance, existing research often falls short in capturing the relationship between internet use and well-being, relying primarily on isolated studies and self-reported data. One major contributor to deteriorated well-being is stress. While some research has examined the relationship between internet use and stress, both positive and negative associations have been reported.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    This study aimed to identify the associations between an individual’s internet use and their stress.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    We conducted a 7-month longitudinal study. We combined fine-grained URL-level web browsing traces of 1490 German internet users with their sociodemographics and monthly measures of stress. Further, we developed a conceptual framework that allows us to simultaneously explore different contextual dimensions, including how, where, when, and by whom the internet is used. We applied linear mixed-effects models to examine these associations.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    
                      Our analysis revealed several associations between internet use and stress, varying by context. Increased time spent on social media, online shopping, and gaming platforms was associated with higher stress. For example, the time spent by individuals on shopping-related internet use (aggregated over the 30 days before their stress was measured via questionnaires) was positively associated with stress on both mobile (
                      β
                      =.04, 95% CI 0.00‐0.08;
                      P
                      =.04) and desktop devices (
                      β
                      =.03, 95% CI −0.00 to 0.06;
                      P
                      =.09). In contrast, time spent on productivity or news websites was associated with lower stress. Specifically, in the last 30 days of mobile usage, productivity-related use showed a negative association with stress (
                      β
                      =−.03, 95% CI −0.06 to −0.00;
                      P
                      =.04). In addition, in the last 2 days of data, news usage was negatively associated with stress on both mobile (
                      β
                      =−.54, 95% CI −1.08 to 0.00;
                      P
                      =.048) and desktop devices (
                      β
                      =−.50, 95% CI−0.90 to −0.11;
                      P
                      =.01). Further analysis showed that total time spent online (
                      β
                      =.01, 95% CI 0.00‐0.02;
                      P
                      &amp;lt;.001), social-media usage (
                      β
                      =.02, 95% CI 0.00‐0.03;
                      P
                      =.02), and gaming usage (
                      β
                      =.01, 95% CI 0.00‐0.02;
                      P
                      =.02) were all positively associated with stress in high-stress Perceived Stress Scale (PSS&amp;gt;26) individuals on mobile devices.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    The findings indicate that internet use is associated with stress, and these associations differ across various usage contexts. In the future, the behavioral markers we identified can pave the way for designing individualized tools for people to self-monitor and self-moderate their online behaviors to enhance their well-being, reducing the burden on already overburdened mental health services.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Background
                    The rapid growth of social media as an information channel has enabled the swift spread of inaccurate or false health information, significantly impacting public health. This widespread dissemination of misinformation has caused confusion, eroded trust in health authorities, led to noncompliance with health guidelines, and encouraged risky health behaviors. Understanding the dynamics of misinformation on social media is essential for devising effective public health communication strategies.
                  
                  
                    Objective
                    This study aims to present a comprehensive and automated approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and machine learning techniques to detect misinformation on social media, uncover the underlying causes and themes, and generate refutation arguments, facilitating control of its spread and promoting public health outcomes by inoculating people against health misinformation.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    We use 2 datasets to train 3 LLMs, namely, BERT, T5, and GPT-2, to classify documents into 2 categories: misinformation and nonmisinformation. In addition, we use a separate dataset to identify misinformation topics. To analyze these topics, we applied 3 topic modeling algorithms—Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Top2Vec, and BERTopic—and selected the optimal model based on performance evaluated across 3 metrics. Using a prompting approach, we extract sentence-level representations for the topics to uncover their underlying themes. Finally, we design a prompt text capable of identifying misinformation themes effectively.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    The trained BERT model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 98% accuracy in classifying misinformation and nonmisinformation, with a 44% reduction in false-positive rates for artificial intelligence–generated misinformation. Among the 3 topic modeling approaches used, BERTopic outperformed the others, achieving the highest metrics with a Coherence Value of 0.41, Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information of −0.086, and Inverse Rank-Biased Overlap of 0.99. To address the issue of unclassified documents, we developed an algorithm to assign each document to its closest topic. In addition, we proposed a novel method using prompt engineering to generate sentence-level representations for each topic, achieving a 99.6% approval rate as “appropriate” or “somewhat appropriate” by 3 independent raters. We further designed a prompt text to identify themes of misinformation topics and developed another prompt capable of detecting misinformation themes with 82% accuracy.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    This study presents a comprehensive and automated approach to addressing health misinformation on social media using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. By leveraging LLMs and prompt engineering, the system effectively detects misinformation, identifies underlying themes, and provides explanatory responses to combat its spread. The proposed method was tested on an English language COVID-19–related dataset and has not been evaluated on real-world online social media data; the experiments were conducted offline.
