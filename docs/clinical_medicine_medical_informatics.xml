Abstract: 
            Background
            The cholinergic system mediates essential aspects of cognitive function, yet its structure and function decline progressively with age, by an estimated 2.5% per decade across the lifespan. Cognitive training may help counteract age-related declines in cholinergic functioning and slow associated deficits in cognitive performance.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aims to evaluate whether cognitive training modifies cholinergic binding in older adults.
          
          
            Methods
            The Improving Neurological Health in Aging via Neuroplasticity-based Computerized Exercise (INHANCE) trial is a double-blind randomized controlled trial assessing whether 2 computerized cognitive training programs modify cholinergic expression. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 92 community-dwelling healthy older adults aged 65 and above (enrolled July 2021-December 2023; final follow-up June 2024). Participants were randomized at McGill University to either an intervention of speed-based cognitive training exercises designed to improve the speed and accuracy of information processing or an active control of nonspeeded games designed for entertainment (eg, similar in design to Solitaire). Participants completed 35 hours of training on their assigned program at home over a 10-week period using a loaned or personal internet-connected device. Cholinergic binding was measured with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter ligand [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV) and positron emission tomography (PET). The primary outcome was mean FEOBV binding (standard uptake value ratios [SUVRs]) within the anterior cingulate cortex from baseline to posttest in the ITT population. All other end points were exploratory.
          
          
            Results
            Among the 92 participants in the ITT population (mean age 71.9 years; mean education 16.5 years; 61/92, 66%, women; 88/92, 96%, White), 82 (89%) completed all study activities. The speed-based intervention showed a significant within-group increase in FEOBV binding in the primary region of interest, the anterior cingulate cortex (SUVR change mean +0.044, 95% CI 0.006-0.082, P=.03, medium effect size, ω²=0.09). The p24c subregion demonstrated a significant between-groups effect favoring speed training (speeded vs nonspeeded SUVR change difference +0.058, 95% CI 0.007-0.110, P=.03, small effect size, ω²=0.05). Prespecified exploratory analyses revealed significant within-group effects for speed training in the hippocampus (P=.02) and parahippocampal gyrus (P=.04). No effects on FEOBV binding were observed in the active control group.
          
          
            Conclusions
            INHANCE is the largest FEOBV-PET trial to date and demonstrates, for the first time in humans, that speed training can reverse losses in cholinergic terminal densities in brain regions vulnerable to age-related cognitive decline. The 2.3% gain in FEOBV binding in the anterior cingulate achieved over a 10-week intervention may offset the estimated 2.5% decline typically observed over a decade of natural aging. These findings clarify the neurochemical basis of cognitive training benefits, showing that speed training upregulates binding in networks that support attention, memory, and executive function.

Abstract: Abstract
                  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a vulnerability arising from being trained to be helpful: a tendency to comply with illogical requests that would generate false information, even when they have the knowledge to identify the request as illogical. This study investigated this vulnerability in the medical domain, evaluating five frontier LLMs using prompts that misrepresent equivalent drug relationships. We tested baseline sycophancy, the impact of prompts allowing rejection and emphasizing factual recall, and the effects of fine-tuning on a dataset of illogical requests, including out-of-distribution generalization. Results showed high initial compliance (up to 100%) across all models, prioritizing helpfulness over logical consistency. Prompt engineering and fine-tuning improved performance, improving rejection rates on illogical requests while maintaining general benchmark performance. This demonstrates that prioritizing logical consistency through targeted training and prompting is crucial for mitigating the risk of generating false medical information and ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Radiolucent foreign body aspiration (FBA) remains diagnostically challenging due to its subtle imaging signatures on chest CT scans, often leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. We present a deep learning model integrating MedpSeg, a high-precision airway segmentation method, with a convolutional classifier to detect radiolucent FBA. The model was trained and validated across three independent cohorts, demonstrating consistent performance with accuracies above 90% and balanced recall–precision metrics. In a blinded independent evaluation cohort, the model outperformed expert radiologists in both recall (71.4%
                    vs
                    . 35.7%) and F1 score (74.1%
                    vs
                    . 52.6%), highlighting its potential to reduce missed cases (false negatives) and support clinical decision-making. This study illustrates the translational potential of artificial intelligence for addressing diagnostically complex and high-risk conditions, offering an effective tool to support radiologists in the assessment of suspected radiolucent foreign body aspiration.
