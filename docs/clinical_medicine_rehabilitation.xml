Abstract: 
                    Purpose:
                    Automated analysis of naturalistic speech has emerged as an effective tool for detecting cognitive decline in dementia but has seldom been used to examine the ordinary cognitive decline occurring in normal aging. Executive function (EF) declines throughout the adult lifespan but is difficult to track longitudinally due to practice effects, making speech-based assessments particularly attractive. This study examined relationships between EF and speech characteristics.
                  
                  
                    Method:
                    We collected two audio picture descriptions from participants in two experiments that also included EF assessments, with 67 healthy older adults (aged 65–75 years) in Study 1 and 174 healthy adults (aged 18–90 years) in Study 2. Language composite scores were computed by aggregating relevant speech features indexing aspects of speech that have been reported to show changes in pathological aging. Principal components reflecting common covariation in speech features were extracted from a large training data set to compute speech domain scores. The relationships between language composites/speech principal components and EF were assessed while controlling for age, gender, and education.
                  
                  
                    Results:
                    In Study 1, older adults' word-finding difficulties, measured as speech disfluencies, showed significant associations with EF. Study 2 confirms that speech disfluencies can explain individual differences in EF not only for adults above the age of 65 years but also across the adult lifespan. Information units and coherence in speech showed weaker associations with EF and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores that were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion:
                    The findings revealed associations between word-finding ability in natural speech and general EF across the adult lifespan, supporting natural speech analysis as a convenient and sensitive assessment of general cognitive ability.

Abstract: Abstract
                  
                    Currently, most states in the United States have enacted legislation mandating universal screening for literacy risk in kindergarten through 3rd grade. However, the degree to which these policies translate into consistent, high-quality screening practices remains unclear. In this survey study, we collected responses from a diverse sample of K–3 educators (
                    N
                     = 251) across 39 states, representing varied school types, professional roles, and experience levels, to examine the real-world implementation of universal screening. Guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework, we analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to identify real-world factors that could impede the fidelity and effectiveness of screening implementation. We found substantial variability across multiple dimensions of literacy screening implementation. Educators described considerable variation in screener selection, administration practices, testing environments, training quality, scoring accuracy, and the use of results to guide intervention. Notably, many indicated insufficient training and professional development, expressing uncertainty about administering and interpreting screeners, particularly for English language learners. Nearly half also reported the absence of systematic procedures for developing intervention plans, suggesting that many students identified as at risk do not receive appropriate follow-up support. These implementation challenges occurred despite widespread recognition among educators of screening’s importance for early literacy intervention. Educators from lower-socioeconomic status schools reported significantly greater time burdens in conducting screenings and more technology-related challenges compared to their higher-SES counterparts. Without systematic improvements to implementation support and training, current screening initiatives may fail to achieve their intended goal of early identification and intervention for struggling readers.

Abstract: 
                    Purpose:
                    The aim of this tutorial is to show how the rise of molecular technologies and analytical methods in human genetics yields exciting new ways to understand the biological foundations of spoken and written language. The focus is on complementary strategies capturing genetic variation of different kinds (rare gene disruptions and common DNA polymorphisms), discussing how these can be associated with developmental speech, language, and reading disorders as well as with interindividual differences in the general population.
                  
                  
                    Results:
                    
                      The first half of the tutorial discusses rare variants that are sufficient themselves to cause a severe speech and/or language disorder. This begins with lessons learned from studying
                      FOXP2
                      disruptions that cause childhood apraxia of speech, accompanied by impaired language production and comprehension, before considering how genome or exome sequencing has uncovered pathogenic variants in an array of additional neurodevelopmental genes, including
                      CHD3
                      ,
                      DDX3X
                      ,
                      KAT6A
                      ,
                      SETBP1
                      ,
                      SETD1A
                      ,
                      WDR5
                      , and
                      ZFHX4
                      . The second half of the tutorial covers the study of common DNA variants with individually tiny effect sizes, highlighting the challenges of robustly associating them with variability in language-related skills. Against this background, a shift from small candidate gene studies to large-scale genome-wide association study designs is transforming the landscape of the field, gaining leverage from team science approaches and personal genomics. The shift is illustrated with selected examples of recent studies of relevant quantitative measures and diagnostic status in many thousands of participants.
                    
                  
                  
                    Conclusions:
                    This work demonstrates the dramatic impact genomic innovations are having on the language sciences and how molecular genetic approaches can address long-standing questions about neurobiology and the evolution of distinctive human traits. Potential translational consequences for speech or language pathology vary according to the types of DNA variation and will benefit from enhanced communication about the roles of genomics in clinical contexts.

Abstract: 
                    Purpose:
                    We aimed to create a comprehensive understanding of the dilemmas involved in the diagnosis of developmental language disorder (DLD) and to highlight the potential of a multidimensional spectral account of DLD for addressing these dilemmas.
                  
                  
                    Method:
                    We conducted an integrative literature review.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions:
                    Considerable gains in understanding the genetics and neurobiology of DLD provide new explanations for long-observed phenomena such as heterogeneity of presentation, phenotypic overlap with other neurodevelopmental conditions, and the challenges of diagnosis. Although categorical nosologies benefit diagnostic decision making, facilitate communication, and align well with bureaucratic systems, they offer overly simple ways of defining DLD. The presentation of DLD is broad rather than narrow, spectral rather than categorical, and dynamic rather than static; therefore, DLD is better described as a multidimensional spectral system than as a categorical entity. It is not practical or even advisable to abandon the traditional categorical framing of DLD at this point. However, maintaining awareness of the tension between the categorical framing and the spectral nature of DLD may improve diagnosis, prognosis, and alignment with the construct of neurodiversity.
