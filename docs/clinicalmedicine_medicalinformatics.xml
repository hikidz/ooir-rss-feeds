            Abstract 
          
          
            Background
            Work engagement is an important determinant of workers’ well-being. According to the job demands–resources model, personal resources are one of the key antecedents of work engagement. Enhancing personal resources leads to improved work engagement. Furthermore, reflecting positively on one’s achievements at work may enhance personal resources. Hence, there is a need for a simple, self-guided tool such as a smartphone app that can be used by employees to record and reflect on their work accomplishments.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a smartphone-based diary (ie, Work Engagement Diary) that promotes positive reflection in daily working life on work engagement among Japanese workers in a randomized controlled trial.
          
          
            Methods
            Six hundred Japanese workers who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the wait-list control group (300 participants each) via a web survey company. Participants in the intervention group kept the Work Engagement Diary for 2 weeks, whereby they were required to set a weekly goal at the beginning of the week and fill in their work achievements at the end of the day. Those in the waitlist control group did not receive any interventions until they completed a follow-up survey. Work engagement was assessed at preintervention (T1), postintervention (T2), and 3 weeks after intervention (T3) in both groups.
          
          
            Results
            A mixed model for repeated measures conditional growth model analysis using intention-to-treat revealed a significant improvement in work engagement for the intervention group compared to the wait-list control group throughout the study period (P=.04). Effect sizes were small in work engagement for T1 versus T2 (Cohen d=0.11 [95% CI −0.06 to 0.28]) and for T1 versus T3 (Cohen d=0.12 [95% CI −0.06 to 0.28]).
          
          
            Conclusions
            This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that our newly developed smartphone-based positive reflection diary at work effectively improved work engagement among Japanese workers. Future research needs to clarify longer-term intervention effects and detailed mechanisms of the intervention effects.

Abstract: 
            Background
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital health, particularly through large language models (LLMs), to support patient engagement and behavior change. One novel application is the delivery of motivational interviewing (MI), an evidence-based, patient-centered counseling technique designed to enhance motivation and resolve ambivalence around health behaviors. AI tools, including chatbots, mobile apps, and web-based agents, are being developed to simulate MI techniques at scale. While these innovations are promising, important questions remain about how faithfully AI systems can replicate MI principles or achieve meaningful behavioral impact.
          
          
            Objective
            This scoping review aimed to summarize existing empirical studies evaluating AI-driven systems that apply MI techniques to support health behavior change. Specifically, we examined the feasibility of these systems; their fidelity to MI principles; and their reported behavioral, psychological, or engagement outcomes.
          
          
            Methods
            We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for empirical studies published between January 1, 2018, and February 25, 2025. Eligible studies involved AI-driven systems using natural language generation, understanding, or computational logic to deliver MI techniques to users targeting a specific health behavior. We excluded studies using AI solely for training clinicians in MI. Three independent reviewers screened and extracted data on study design, AI modality and type, MI components, health behavior focus, MI fidelity assessment, and outcome domains.
          
          
            Results
            Of the 1001 records identified, 15 (1.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Of these 15 studies, 6 (40%) were exploratory feasibility or pilot studies, and 3 (20%) were randomized controlled trials. AI modalities included rule-based chatbots (9/15, 60%), LLM-based systems (4/15, 27%), and virtual or mobile agents (2/15, 13%). Targeted behaviors included smoking cessation (6/15, 40%), substance use (3/15, 20%), COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, type 2 diabetes self-management, stress, mental health service use, and opioid use during pregnancy. Of the 15 studies, 13 (87%) reported positive findings on feasibility or user acceptability, while 6 (40%) assessed MI fidelity using expert review or structured coding, with moderate to high alignment reported. Several studies found that users perceived the AI systems as judgment free, supportive, and easier to engage with than human counselors, particularly in stigmatized contexts. However, limitations in empathy, safety transparency, and emotional nuance were commonly noted. Only 3 (20%) of the 15 studies reported substantially significant behavioral changes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            AI systems delivering MI show promise for enhancing patient engagement and scaling behavior change interventions. Early evidence supports their usability and partial fidelity to MI principles, especially in sensitive domains. However, most systems remain in early development, and few have been rigorously tested. Future research should prioritize randomized evaluations; standardized fidelity measures; and safeguards for LLM safety, empathy, and accuracy in health-related dialogue.

Abstract: 
            Background
            Hospital readmissions pose a significant burden on patients, health care providers, and systems, with an estimated annual cost of $17 billion. Timely follow-up within 7 days postdischarge is known to reduce readmissions but is often limited by access constraints. While transitions of care clinics have demonstrated benefits in reducing unplanned readmissions, physical space requirements can be logistically and financially challenging.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual transitions of care (VToC) clinic in reducing 30-day hospital readmissions and improving postdischarge care coordination.
          
          
            Methods
            University of California, San Diego Health implemented a hospitalist-led VToC clinic designed to support clinical management, medication reconciliation, primary care provider repatriation, and specialty care navigation. The study included 2314 patients seen in the VToC clinic between September 2021 and September 2024. Outcomes were compared to a benchmark group using regression analysis to assess the impact on 30-day readmission rates.
          
          
            Results
            The 30-day readmission rate for VToC patients was 14.9% (344/2314), significantly lower than the 20.1% (4659/23,129) observed in the benchmark group (P&amp;lt;.001). Regression analysis indicated that patients not participating in the VToC clinic had a higher likelihood of readmission (odds ratio=1.37; 95% CI=1.21-1.54; P&amp;lt;.001). The most substantial reduction in readmissions was observed among patients with moderate readmission risk (LACE+ score of 50-75).
          
          
            Conclusions
            VToC clinics are a feasible and effective strategy for enhancing postdischarge care, reducing hospital readmissions, and improving care coordination. This model supports the quadruple aim by promoting better health outcomes, improved patient experience, cost-efficiency, and care equity.
