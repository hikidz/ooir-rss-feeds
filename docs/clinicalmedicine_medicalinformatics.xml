Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            The growing adoption of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms in health care has led to concerns about the perpetuation of algorithmic bias against disadvantaged groups of individuals. Deep learning methods to detect and mitigate bias have revolved around modifying models, optimization strategies, and threshold calibration with varying levels of success and tradeoffs. However, there have been limited substantive efforts to address bias at the level of the data used to generate algorithms in health care datasets.
          
          
            Objective
            The aim of this study is to create a simple metric (AEquity) that uses a learning curve approximation to distinguish and mitigate bias via guided dataset collection or relabeling.
          
          
            Methods
            We demonstrate this metric in 2 well-known examples, chest X-rays and health care cost utilization, and detect novel biases in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
          
          
            Results
            We demonstrated that using AEquity to guide data-centric collection for each diagnostic finding in the chest radiograph dataset decreased bias by between 29% and 96.5% when measured by differences in area under the curve. Next, we wanted to examine (1) whether AEquity worked on intersectional populations and (2) if AEquity is invariant to different types of fairness metrics, not just area under the curve. Subsequently, we examined the effect of AEquity on mitigating bias when measured by false negative rate, precision, and false discovery rate for Black patients on Medicaid. When we examined Black patients on Medicaid, at the intersection of race and socioeconomic status, we found that AEquity-based interventions reduced bias across a number of different fairness metrics including overall false negative rate by 33.3% (bias reduction absolute=1.88×10−1, 95% CI 1.4×10−1 to 2.5×10−1; bias reduction of 33.3%, 95% CI 26.6%‐40%; precision bias by 7.50×10−2, 95% CI 7.48×10−2 to 7.51×10−2; bias reduction of 94.6%, 95% CI 94.5%‐94.7%; false discovery rate by 94.5%; absolute bias reduction=3.50×10−2, 95% CI 3.49×10−2 to 3.50×10−2). Similarly, AEquity-guided data collection demonstrated bias reduction of up to 80% on mortality prediction with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (bias reduction absolute=0.08, 95% CI 0.07-0.09). Then, we wanted to compare AEquity to state-of-the-art data-guided debiasing measures such as balanced empirical risk minimization and calibration. Consequently, we benchmarked against balanced empirical risk minimization and calibration and showed that AEquity-guided data collection outperforms both standard approaches. Moreover, we demonstrated that AEquity works on fully connected networks; convolutional neural networks such as ResNet-50; transformer architectures such as VIT-B-16, a vision transformer with 86 million parameters; and nonparametric methods such as Light Gradient-Boosting Machine.
          
          
            Conclusions
            In short, we demonstrated that AEquity is a robust tool by applying it to different datasets, algorithms, and intersectional analyses and measuring its effectiveness with respect to a range of traditional fairness metrics.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Telehealth may redress rural health care shortages in the United States and improve related rural health disparities. However, following the expansion of telehealth related to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth use has been lower among rural populations compared to urban populations. Certain populations are also more likely to use audio-only telehealth, with implications for care quality.
          
          
            Objective
            The aim of this study is to describe demographic and telehealth use characteristics of a population of rural-dwelling adult patients and explore relationships of these characteristics with patients’ level of rurality and with modality of patients’ most recent telehealth encounter.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a retrospective medical record review of adults who lived in rural California zip codes and used telehealth at an urban medical center from December 2021 to December 2022. Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes were used to assign rurality and group patients by 3 levels of rurality. Telehealth visits were defined as video-enabled and telephone encounters. Variables included age, race or ethnicity, preferred language, payer, web-based patient portal activation status (as proxy for digital health literacy), video or telephone modality, and visit provider. Chi-square and Fisher exact tested associations of demographic and encounter characteristics with patient level of rurality and telehealth encounter modality.
          
          
            Results
            A total of 9359 patients were included. Telehealth patients living in the most rural zip codes were older, and a higher proportion were White compared to those in less rural zip codes. Patients who were American Indian, Asian, Black, and Latino together comprised 18.8% (n=1760) of the sample, lower than that in rural California counties. Video visit use was significantly lower among patients who were 65 years of age or older (n=3183, 91.3% vs n=5507, 93.8% for younger than 65 years; χ21=19.3; P&amp;lt;.001), Latino race or ethnicity (n=1229, 90.9% vs n=6078, 93.4% among White patients; χ23=12.0; P=.008), primary Spanish speakers (n=336, 87.7% vs n=8305, 93% among English speakers; Fisher exact, P&amp;lt;.001), and publicly insured (Medicare: n=3843, 91.7%; Medicaid: n=1717, 92.2%; privately insured: n=3130, 94.7%; χ22=27.9; P&amp;lt;.001). Patient portal activation was lower among Latinx patients (n=1183, 87.5% vs n=6099, 93.7% among White patients), Spanish speakers (n=295, 77% vs n=8241, 92.3% among English speakers; Fisher exact: P&amp;lt;.001), and Medicaid patients (n=1635, 87.8%; Medicare: n=3802, 90.7%; privately insured: n=3140, 95%; χ24=106.3; P&amp;lt;.001).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Findings substantiate concerns of rural telehealth access disparities, particularly among patients who are older, of minoritized race or ethnicity, and Spanish-speaking. Ongoing research is needed to understand how underserved rural populations use telehealth. To address telehealth use disparities, policy should address patient-level barriers by supporting measures such as health care navigation resources, culturally tailored telehealth patient outreach, digital access assessment, and patient digital education. Evidence-based telehealth reimbursement policy is essential to support access and address provider-side barriers.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Telemedicine has revolutionized the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care by improving access to health care services and enhancing health outcomes. Despite these advancements, it remains unclear whether telemedicine has reduced access inequalities among different demographic and socioeconomic groups.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to investigate the most important demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with telemedicine use among individuals with T2DM in primary care.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched from inception to December 2023. The reference lists of eligible studies and other relevant systematic reviews were also searched. We included observational and cohort studies that assessed the effects of telemedicine interventions on individuals with T2DM in primary care. The core outcomes were the factors associated with telemedicine use, reported as adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs for each factor, using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic, and publication bias was assessed. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024550410).
          
          
            Results
            Of the 3006 records identified, 16 studies involving 71,336 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Female patients had higher odds of using telemedicine than males (pooled adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09). Older patients were significantly less likely to use telemedicine than younger patients (pooled OR 0.979, 95% CI 0.98-0.98). Compared with White patients, Black patients were less likely to use telemedicine (pooled OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.94), while no statistically significant differences were observed for Hispanic (pooled OR 1.075, 95% CI 0.36-3.24) or Asian participants (pooled OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29-1.06). Patients with higher education levels had greater odds of using telemedicine than those with lower education levels (pooled OR 1.681, 95% CI 1.48-1.91).
          
          
            Conclusions
            This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence of significant disparities in telemedicine use among men, older adults, Black individuals, and those with lower levels of education who have T2DM in primary care. Given that these groups are among the most vulnerable to T2DM, these disparities highlight the critical need for strategic interventions and robust policies that ensure telemedicine fosters equitable access to health care while preventing further exacerbation of existing health inequalities.

Abstract: 
            Background
            Hospital readmissions pose a significant burden on patients, health care providers, and systems, with an estimated annual cost of $17 billion. Timely follow-up within 7 days postdischarge is known to reduce readmissions but is often limited by access constraints. While transitions of care clinics have demonstrated benefits in reducing unplanned readmissions, physical space requirements can be logistically and financially challenging.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual transitions of care (VToC) clinic in reducing 30-day hospital readmissions and improving postdischarge care coordination.
          
          
            Methods
            University of California, San Diego Health implemented a hospitalist-led VToC clinic designed to support clinical management, medication reconciliation, primary care provider repatriation, and specialty care navigation. The study included 2314 patients seen in the VToC clinic between September 2021 and September 2024. Outcomes were compared to a benchmark group using regression analysis to assess the impact on 30-day readmission rates.
          
          
            Results
            The 30-day readmission rate for VToC patients was 14.9% (344/2314), significantly lower than the 20.1% (4659/23,129) observed in the benchmark group (P&amp;lt;.001). Regression analysis indicated that patients not participating in the VToC clinic had a higher likelihood of readmission (odds ratio=1.37; 95% CI=1.21-1.54; P&amp;lt;.001). The most substantial reduction in readmissions was observed among patients with moderate readmission risk (LACE+ score of 50-75).
          
          
            Conclusions
            VToC clinics are a feasible and effective strategy for enhancing postdischarge care, reducing hospital readmissions, and improving care coordination. This model supports the quadruple aim by promoting better health outcomes, improved patient experience, cost-efficiency, and care equity.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Telemedicine is an effective and promising strategy, especially for the initial stages of a home-based therapeutic exercise program.
          
          
            
              Objective
            
            The objectives of this study were 2-fold: first, to assess whether Tai Chi practice combined with wearable device-based monitoring improves cognitive function in this population, and second, to explore the underlying mechanisms for any improvements observed, including changes in physical activity levels and sleep patterns.
          
          
            Methods
            The study was a randomized controlled trial in which participants were randomized (1:1:1) to receive usual care, fitness walking, or Tai Chi exercise. All indicators were assessed at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The usual care includes traditional diabetes education. Participants in the fitness walking group performed walking exercises on a treadmill under the supervision of a researcher 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants in the Tai Chi group practiced 24-style Simplified Tai Chi through live video streaming under the guidance of professors and professionals. In this 12-week program, participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using Guardian Sensors 3, CGM sensors attached to the upper arm. All participants carried bracelets to record their heart rate, sleep parameters, and steps. The primary outcome was the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included other cognitive subdomain tests and blood metabolic indices. The MoCA is a tool designed for rapid screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia, with the core advantage of being more sensitive to early cognitive problems. The MoCA has a total score of 30. Lower scores may indicate the presence of cognitive dysfunction.
          
          
            Results
            After 12 weeks of intervention, the Tai Chi exercise group showed a significant improvement in MoCA scores from baseline (mean difference 23.83, 95% CI 17.79-25.66 vs 21.42, 95% CI 17.11-24.74; P=.03). The fitness walking exercise group showed an improvement in MoCA scores (22.94, 95% CI 18.05-23.98 vs 21.58, 95% CI 17.35-24.12; P.08), but this did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, there was a statistical difference in the improvement of MoCA scores between the Tai Chi and fitness walking groups (2.65, 95% CI 0.34-4.41 vs 1.44, 95% CI 0.89-2.87; P&amp;lt;.05). The usual care group showed the least change in score at both points (0.23, 95% CI −0.02 to 1.39; P=.83). Compared with the MQ in the fitness walking group (91.93, 95% CI 77.83-97.47) vs 88.62, 95% CI 77.14-95.84; P=.45), Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B) (220.81, 95% CI 210.03-233.49 vs 223.66, 95% CI 215.04-230.27; P=.33), the Tai Chi group was more effective in improving the MQ (99.23, 95% CI 80.55-107.69 vs 89.23, 95% CI 78.16-96.08; P=.001), TMT-B (207.33, 95% CI 200.26-220.82 vs 225.58, 95% CI 214.12-234.94; P=.001) scores, and there were significant differences between the two groups.
          
          
            Conclusions
            In summary, this study demonstrated that web-based exercise therapy for patients may enhance the effectiveness of exercise therapy in improving cognitive function among older individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Tai Chi has significant advantages in improving cognitive function and sleep quality, while fitness walking, although also beneficial, is relatively weak in these areas.
