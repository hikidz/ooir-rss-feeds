Abstract: 
            Background
            Hospital readmissions pose a significant burden on patients, health care providers, and systems, with an estimated annual cost of $17 billion. Timely follow-up within 7 days postdischarge is known to reduce readmissions but is often limited by access constraints. While transitions of care clinics have demonstrated benefits in reducing unplanned readmissions, physical space requirements can be logistically and financially challenging.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual transitions of care (VToC) clinic in reducing 30-day hospital readmissions and improving postdischarge care coordination.
          
          
            Methods
            University of California, San Diego Health implemented a hospitalist-led VToC clinic designed to support clinical management, medication reconciliation, primary care provider repatriation, and specialty care navigation. The study included 2314 patients seen in the VToC clinic between September 2021 and September 2024. Outcomes were compared to a benchmark group using regression analysis to assess the impact on 30-day readmission rates.
          
          
            Results
            The 30-day readmission rate for VToC patients was 14.9% (344/2314), significantly lower than the 20.1% (4659/23,129) observed in the benchmark group (P&amp;lt;.001). Regression analysis indicated that patients not participating in the VToC clinic had a higher likelihood of readmission (odds ratio=1.37; 95% CI=1.21-1.54; P&amp;lt;.001). The most substantial reduction in readmissions was observed among patients with moderate readmission risk (LACE+ score of 50-75).
          
          
            Conclusions
            VToC clinics are a feasible and effective strategy for enhancing postdischarge care, reducing hospital readmissions, and improving care coordination. This model supports the quadruple aim by promoting better health outcomes, improved patient experience, cost-efficiency, and care equity.

Abstract: 
            Background
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital health, particularly through large language models (LLMs), to support patient engagement and behavior change. One novel application is the delivery of motivational interviewing (MI), an evidence-based, patient-centered counseling technique designed to enhance motivation and resolve ambivalence around health behaviors. AI tools, including chatbots, mobile apps, and web-based agents, are being developed to simulate MI techniques at scale. While these innovations are promising, important questions remain about how faithfully AI systems can replicate MI principles or achieve meaningful behavioral impact.
          
          
            Objective
            This scoping review aimed to summarize existing empirical studies evaluating AI-driven systems that apply MI techniques to support health behavior change. Specifically, we examined the feasibility of these systems; their fidelity to MI principles; and their reported behavioral, psychological, or engagement outcomes.
          
          
            Methods
            We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for empirical studies published between January 1, 2018, and February 25, 2025. Eligible studies involved AI-driven systems using natural language generation, understanding, or computational logic to deliver MI techniques to users targeting a specific health behavior. We excluded studies using AI solely for training clinicians in MI. Three independent reviewers screened and extracted data on study design, AI modality and type, MI components, health behavior focus, MI fidelity assessment, and outcome domains.
          
          
            Results
            Of the 1001 records identified, 15 (1.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Of these 15 studies, 6 (40%) were exploratory feasibility or pilot studies, and 3 (20%) were randomized controlled trials. AI modalities included rule-based chatbots (9/15, 60%), LLM-based systems (4/15, 27%), and virtual or mobile agents (2/15, 13%). Targeted behaviors included smoking cessation (6/15, 40%), substance use (3/15, 20%), COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, type 2 diabetes self-management, stress, mental health service use, and opioid use during pregnancy. Of the 15 studies, 13 (87%) reported positive findings on feasibility or user acceptability, while 6 (40%) assessed MI fidelity using expert review or structured coding, with moderate to high alignment reported. Several studies found that users perceived the AI systems as judgment free, supportive, and easier to engage with than human counselors, particularly in stigmatized contexts. However, limitations in empathy, safety transparency, and emotional nuance were commonly noted. Only 3 (20%) of the 15 studies reported substantially significant behavioral changes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            AI systems delivering MI show promise for enhancing patient engagement and scaling behavior change interventions. Early evidence supports their usability and partial fidelity to MI principles, especially in sensitive domains. However, most systems remain in early development, and few have been rigorously tested. Future research should prioritize randomized evaluations; standardized fidelity measures; and safeguards for LLM safety, empathy, and accuracy in health-related dialogue.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Telemedicine has revolutionized the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care by improving access to health care services and enhancing health outcomes. Despite these advancements, it remains unclear whether telemedicine has reduced access inequalities among different demographic and socioeconomic groups.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aimed to investigate the most important demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with telemedicine use among individuals with T2DM in primary care.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched from inception to December 2023. The reference lists of eligible studies and other relevant systematic reviews were also searched. We included observational and cohort studies that assessed the effects of telemedicine interventions on individuals with T2DM in primary care. The core outcomes were the factors associated with telemedicine use, reported as adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs for each factor, using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic, and publication bias was assessed. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024550410).
          
          
            Results
            Of the 3006 records identified, 16 studies involving 71,336 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Female patients had higher odds of using telemedicine than males (pooled adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09). Older patients were significantly less likely to use telemedicine than younger patients (pooled OR 0.979, 95% CI 0.98-0.98). Compared with White patients, Black patients were less likely to use telemedicine (pooled OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.94), while no statistically significant differences were observed for Hispanic (pooled OR 1.075, 95% CI 0.36-3.24) or Asian participants (pooled OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29-1.06). Patients with higher education levels had greater odds of using telemedicine than those with lower education levels (pooled OR 1.681, 95% CI 1.48-1.91).
          
          
            Conclusions
            This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence of significant disparities in telemedicine use among men, older adults, Black individuals, and those with lower levels of education who have T2DM in primary care. Given that these groups are among the most vulnerable to T2DM, these disparities highlight the critical need for strategic interventions and robust policies that ensure telemedicine fosters equitable access to health care while preventing further exacerbation of existing health inequalities.
