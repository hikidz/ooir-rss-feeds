Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            The prevalence of herbal products (HPs) consumption among pregnant and postpartum women, the factors driving their use or the main sources of recommendation have never been studied in Spain or Catalonia. Investigating its prevalence of use during critical phases of development is crucial for providing guidance to health professionals.
          
          
            Methods
            A validated questionnaire, containing general data on socio-demographic status, lifestyle, maternal health data and its association with HP consumption, was performed in online personal interviews among women living in Catalonia between pregnancy week 22 and postpartum month 9.
          
          
            Results
            We identified a higher percentage of HPs consumption compared to other European countries, while the 5 most consumed products were similar to the products described to be consumed by pregnant women in other countries. The most frequently consumed HPs were ginger (28%), chamomile (9%), thyme (7%), rooibos (6%), cranberry (4%), and raspberry leaf (4%), and we identified specific temporal patterns of consumption for several of them, depending on the trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between women consuming oral HPs and the opinion that “pregnant women should preferably consume herbal remedies rather than conventional medicines”.
          
          
            Conclusions
            We provide evidence that women consuming HPs during pregnancy are not defined by a specific profile and therefore, healthcare professionals should be aware that any woman could potentially consume HPs during this period.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Introduction
            Acupuncture is increasingly utilised in primary care to manage chronic musculoskeletal pain, supported by a growing body of evidence. This rising adoption has driven demand for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We summarised the characteristics of recent acupuncture CPGs for osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain, and shoulder pain, and critically appraised their methodological quality.
          
          
            Methods
            We searched nine databases to identify acupuncture CPGs published from January 2014 to November 2024. Eligible CPGs were required to be developed by guideline committees and to include evidence-informed recommendations linked to clearly defined levels of evidence. Two independent reviewers extracted CPG characteristics and assessed methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.
          
          
            Results
            Of the 1,999 records screened, 17 CPGs were included, encompassing 35 recommendations. Shoulder pain was the most addressed condition (n = 14), followed by low back pain (n = 11), osteoarthritis (n = 8), and neck pain (n = 2). Various types of acupuncture were considered, with manual acupuncture featuring in most (n = 26) recommendations. Overall, 60% of the recommendations supported the use of acupuncture, comprising 5.7% strong recommendations and 54.3% weak or conditional recommendations. In contrast, 22.9% of recommendations offered no explicit guidance, while 17.1% advised against its use. Methodological assessment classified 10 CPGs as high quality, while seven were of moderate quality.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Contradictions exist among the included CPGs regarding whether acupuncture should be recommended for routine practice, potentially reflecting differences in clinical and cultural contexts. Local CPGs should be developed using rigorous methodology, ensuring the involvement of local stakeholders. An AGREE II extension should be developed for the methodological quality assessment of acupuncture CPGs.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            This qualitative study aims to analyse the experiences, perceptions, and motivations of patients with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), who received acupuncture treatments for the symptoms of DPN as part of a Randomized-Controlled Trial (RCT).
          
          
            Methods
            Semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants of a two-arm RCT as part of a mixed-methods study. The interviews were conducted fact-to-face or via phone using a semi-structured interview guide with questions on living with DPN, the medical care for DPN prior to the study, the acupuncture treatments and the overall trial participation.
          
          
            Results
            In total, 10 participants participated between January – December 2020 in this study. All but one participant had positive experiences with acupuncture and reported a reduction of DPN symptoms. They had varying experiences and needs and adopted a range of different coping mechanisms to manage their symptoms and condition prior to participating in the RCT. Many felt dissatisfied with the lack of current treatment options and insufficient medical care for DPN and wished to reduce medication. Acceptance of acupuncture was high, particularly among those wishing to reduce medication. The findings of the qualitative study are in line with the results of the RCT.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Results the qualitative study indicate that acupuncture could be an acceptable and perceived effective treatment option for DPN patients. Declarations.
