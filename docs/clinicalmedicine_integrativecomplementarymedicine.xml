Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is a powerful antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent. Aged garlic has more antioxidant and antimicrobial properties compared to fresh garlic. Garlic has been used for the treatment of many oral and periodontal diseases. However, the efficacy of aged garlic extract (AGE) against periodontal pathogens has never been explored. Hence, this in vitro study aims to assess the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, substantivity, and cytotoxic properties of AGE against key periodontal pathogens and oral tissues.
          
          
            Methods
            The antimicrobial properties of the AGE were evaluated by assessing the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus salivarius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Tannerella forsythia compared to doxycycline and chlorhexidine using the serial dilution method. The antibiofilm properties of AGE were checked for A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum was checked using the standard crystal violet staining assay. The cytocompatibility was checked against human-derived gingival and periodontal fibroblasts and modified oral keratinocytes using 3-4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The substantivity of the extract was checked against chlorhexidine on the dentin surface from extracted tooth samples using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer.
          
          
            Results
            The growth of A. viscosus, F. nucleatum, and S. salivarius was inhibited by AGE at 50 µg/ml. At 25 µg/ml, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were inhibited. P. intermedia growth required a higher concentration of 100 µg/ml. At 25 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml, AGE showed bactericidal activity against A. viscosus and P. intermedia, respectively. The anti-biofilm assay showed that the percentage inhibition was 37.99% for F. nucleatum and 2.52% for A. actinomycetemcomitans. The cell viability of gingival fibroblasts (90%) and modified human keratinocytes (80%) was maintained by AGE at concentrations of 2.5 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml, respectively. The mean difference in substantivity for chlorhexidine and AGE at one minute was statistically significant (p = 0.0112).
          
          
            Conclusion
            AGE was effective in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. However, its antimicrobial effects were not statistically significant when compared to doxycycline. AGE is biocompatible with gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts and has good substantivity to the dentin surface.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Xenobiotic-induced liver injury is a clinically reverent condition which may influence the development of steatohepatitis via affecting numerous pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondorial functioning and fatty acid biosynthesis. The current study was conducted to survey the antioxidant effect of grape seeds extract nanoparticles (GS extract NPs) against CCl4-induced oxidative stress, hepatic dysfunction and inflammatory changes.
          
          
            Methods
            Hydroethanolic Grape seed (GS) extract was prepared and characterized using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Then, GS extract NPs were synthesized and in vitro antioxidant, anticoagulant, cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory testes confirmed biological activity. Finally, Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n = 5/group). Either GS extract (200 mg/kg/day) or GS extract NPs (100 mg/kg/day) were orally administrated independently to CCL4-intoxicated (0.5 ml/kg twice a week for 3 weeks) rats. Four weeks after the treatment, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were monitored. In addition, hepatic Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide dismutases (SOD), Glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) and hepatic inflammatory cytokines were assessed.
          
          
            Results
            GS extract NPs were spherical-shaped and regular particles (size: 16.5 to 22.5 nm and zeta potential: -39.42 mv). CCL4 -intoxicated rats showed increase of serum ALT, AST, ALP, elevation in MDA level accompanied by a decline in SOD, GSH and CAT levels in liver, compared with CCL4-untreated rats. Immunologically, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and hepatic interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-4, IL-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) showed significant elevation, compared with CCL4 -untreated rats. Conversely, GS extract NPs supplementation potentially ameliorate hepatic functions by normalization of serum ALT, AST and ALP, reduced MDA level, improved antioxidant CAT, regulated liver inflammatory cytokines via maximal reduction of hepatic IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α. 
          
          
            Conclusion
            GS extract NPs augmented the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of GS extract thereby protecting the liver against oxidative stress induced by CCl4 as hepatic xenobiotic.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Frequent episodic tension-type headache (FETTH) is a significant public-health concern. Scientific research has demonstrated that acupuncture can improve the clinical symptoms of FETTH.
          
          
            Purpose
            This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of auricular acupuncture and sham acupuncture in treating FETTH.
          
          
            Methods
            This was a randomized controlled trial. Participants with FETTH were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive auricular acupuncture or sham acupuncture for 4 weeks, with follow-up lasting for up to 24 weeks. The primary outcomes were measured using the headache index and visual analog scale (VAS) score. Secondary outcomes included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score, blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (VACA, VMCA, and VPCA, respectively), and the usage of acute headache medications. Adverse events were also recorded to assess safety.
          
          
            Results
            Compared with the sham acupuncture group, the auricular acupuncture group showed significant improvements in VAS score (2 (1.25, 2) vs. 3 (2, 3.5) at 24 h, P &amp;lt; 0.001; 2 (1.25, 2) vs. 2 (2, 3) at the 2nd week, P = 0.004; 2 (1, 2) vs. 2 (1.5, 3) at the 4th week, P = 0.015), headache index (4 (2, 7) vs. 7 (4, 9) at the 4th week, P = 0.016), HAMA score (11.69 ± 2.70) vs. (14.24 ± 3.20) at the 4th week, P &amp;lt; 0.001; (9.83 ± 2.71) vs. (11.95 ± 2.59) at the 8th week, P = 0.001; (9.67 ± 2.65) vs. (11.76 ± 3.00) at the 24th week, P = 0.002), HAMD score ((14.25 ± 2.68) vs. (15.89 ± 3.48) at the 4th week, P = 0.027,) VACA (85.5 (85, 86) vs. 83 (83, 84) at the 4th week, P &amp;lt; 0.001), VPCA (82 (81, 83) vs. 78 (77, 79) at the 4th week, P &amp;lt; 0.001), and usage of acute headache medications (8 (7, 10) vs. 9 (8, 11) at the 4th week, P = 0.030). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the two groups (P = 1.000).
          
          
            Conclusion
            This study found that auricular acupuncture effectively improved the clinical symptoms of FETTH and had relatively fewer side effects. Trial registration: The study was retrospectively registered in the International Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Registry (ITMCTR2025000363) on January 20, 2025.

Abstract: Abstract
          The high prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) worldwide necessitates the attention and intervention of modern medical treatment options. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that Ficus Lyrata leaves can exert protective effects in rats against hepatic fibrosis and hypercholesterolemia. Hence, this study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect of Ficus lyrata Wrab bark extract on the NAFLD rat model. NAFLD was induced through a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks in male Wistar rats. After four weeks of HFD feeding, the rats were treated with F. lyrata extract (250 mg/kg, 5 days/week) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg, 5 days/week) while continuing on the HFD till the end of the experiment. Serum and liver samples were harvested for biochemical, molecular, histopathological, and immunohistochemical investigations. In silico analysis was also conducted to analyse the binding affinity of the extract polyphenols and the key regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. The results revealed that F. lyrata extract administered to HFD-fed rats significantly improved the characteristics of NAFLD by reducing hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and aminotransferases while improving serum lipid profile and adipokines. Moreover, the extract reduced the expression of hepatic lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC-1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and inflammatory markers tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), along with modulating oxidative stress markers and reversing histopathological changes. Molecular docking study revealed that most polyphenolic compounds in F. lyrata extract exhibited good binding affinity towards peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPAR-γ) and liver X receptor α (LXR-α). In conclusion, our findings suggested that F. lyrata bark could be a promising therapeutic agent against the health issues related to NAFLD.
