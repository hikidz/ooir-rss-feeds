Abstract: Abstract
          
            Introduction
            Acupuncture is increasingly utilised in primary care to manage chronic musculoskeletal pain, supported by a growing body of evidence. This rising adoption has driven demand for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We summarised the characteristics of recent acupuncture CPGs for osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain, and shoulder pain, and critically appraised their methodological quality.
          
          
            Methods
            We searched nine databases to identify acupuncture CPGs published from January 2014 to November 2024. Eligible CPGs were required to be developed by guideline committees and to include evidence-informed recommendations linked to clearly defined levels of evidence. Two independent reviewers extracted CPG characteristics and assessed methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.
          
          
            Results
            Of the 1,999 records screened, 17 CPGs were included, encompassing 35 recommendations. Shoulder pain was the most addressed condition (n = 14), followed by low back pain (n = 11), osteoarthritis (n = 8), and neck pain (n = 2). Various types of acupuncture were considered, with manual acupuncture featuring in most (n = 26) recommendations. Overall, 60% of the recommendations supported the use of acupuncture, comprising 5.7% strong recommendations and 54.3% weak or conditional recommendations. In contrast, 22.9% of recommendations offered no explicit guidance, while 17.1% advised against its use. Methodological assessment classified 10 CPGs as high quality, while seven were of moderate quality.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Contradictions exist among the included CPGs regarding whether acupuncture should be recommended for routine practice, potentially reflecting differences in clinical and cultural contexts. Local CPGs should be developed using rigorous methodology, ensuring the involvement of local stakeholders. An AGREE II extension should be developed for the methodological quality assessment of acupuncture CPGs.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            This qualitative study aims to analyse the experiences, perceptions, and motivations of patients with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), who received acupuncture treatments for the symptoms of DPN as part of a Randomized-Controlled Trial (RCT).
          
          
            Methods
            Semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants of a two-arm RCT as part of a mixed-methods study. The interviews were conducted fact-to-face or via phone using a semi-structured interview guide with questions on living with DPN, the medical care for DPN prior to the study, the acupuncture treatments and the overall trial participation.
          
          
            Results
            In total, 10 participants participated between January – December 2020 in this study. All but one participant had positive experiences with acupuncture and reported a reduction of DPN symptoms. They had varying experiences and needs and adopted a range of different coping mechanisms to manage their symptoms and condition prior to participating in the RCT. Many felt dissatisfied with the lack of current treatment options and insufficient medical care for DPN and wished to reduce medication. Acceptance of acupuncture was high, particularly among those wishing to reduce medication. The findings of the qualitative study are in line with the results of the RCT.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Results the qualitative study indicate that acupuncture could be an acceptable and perceived effective treatment option for DPN patients. Declarations.

Abstract: 
            Abstract
            There has been growing interest in animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in recent decades due to increasing reports indicating its health benefits for adult patients. These benefits are partly attributed to changes, usually increased levels of the neuropeptide oxytocin. 
          
          
            Aim
            To investigate changes in oxytocin levels in hospitalized children meeting a certified Hospital Dog®.
          
          
            Method
            Urine samples were collected between 25/02/2016 and 24/05/2017 from 35 hospitalized children (3–17 years) before and after each participant had a session with the Hospital Dog®. Oxytocin levels were analysed with an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Creatinine levels were measured to determine the subject’s fluid intake and then divided by the hormonal concentration (uOT pg/ml).
          
          
            Results
            The mean level of uOT was 186.0 ± 236.7 (51.5–1349.5) pg/ml before and 137.3 ± 121.5 (30.7–591.3) pg/ml after the dog session (p = 0.010).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Decreased levels of uOT were recorded during the study in which hospitalized children met a Hospital Dog®. The decreased OT levels are potentially the result of the intense activity the subject experienced with the dog during the interaction.
