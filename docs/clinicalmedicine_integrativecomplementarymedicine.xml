Abstract: 
            Abstract
            There has been growing interest in animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in recent decades due to increasing reports indicating its health benefits for adult patients. These benefits are partly attributed to changes, usually increased levels of the neuropeptide oxytocin. 
          
          
            Aim
            To investigate changes in oxytocin levels in hospitalized children meeting a certified Hospital Dog®.
          
          
            Method
            Urine samples were collected between 25/02/2016 and 24/05/2017 from 35 hospitalized children (3–17 years) before and after each participant had a session with the Hospital Dog®. Oxytocin levels were analysed with an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Creatinine levels were measured to determine the subject’s fluid intake and then divided by the hormonal concentration (uOT pg/ml).
          
          
            Results
            The mean level of uOT was 186.0 ± 236.7 (51.5–1349.5) pg/ml before and 137.3 ± 121.5 (30.7–591.3) pg/ml after the dog session (p = 0.010).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Decreased levels of uOT were recorded during the study in which hospitalized children met a Hospital Dog®. The decreased OT levels are potentially the result of the intense activity the subject experienced with the dog during the interaction.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            
              Calligonum comosum L’Hér. is a large perennial shrub that grows in the desert. This plant inhabits much of the Egyptian desert, but has not yet been scientifically validated. Herein, we demonstrate the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties of the ethanolic extract of the Egyptian C. comosum (CE) and its novel eco-friendly chitosan nano-formula (CE/CsNPs), which is prepared using citrate as a crosslinker.
          
          
            Methods
            The produced plant ethanolic extract (CE) was chemically analyzed. The eco-friendly CE/CsNPs were successfully developed through the conjugation of CE with different concentrations (200, 350, and 400 mg/100 mL) within the chitosan nanoparticle; then, it was fully characterized for the determination of the optimum formula and followed by the assessment of the antioxidant effects, proinflammatory cytokines, evaluation of cytotoxicity against different types of cancer cell lines, and estimation of antimicrobial effects of CE and CE/CsNPs.
          
          
            Results
            The eco-friendly CE/CsNPs-2 encapsulating 350 mg of CE was selected for the in vitro studies, as it displayed NPs with a small size and a surface charge of 37.7 ± 1.91 mV with the best encapsulation efficiency (70.15 ± 1.58%) within the CsNPs, and it showed a good release profile. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images confirmed the discrete spherical shape of CE/CsNPs-2, with no aggregations, and revealed a size range of 49.69 to 71.93 nm. FTIR displayed the successful incorporation of CE into the eco-friendly CsNPs. Regarding their biological activity, CE/CsNPs have superior efficacy with high cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines and antioxidant effects. RT-qPCR gene expression assessments displayed that CE/CsNPs resulted in a remarkable downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines’ mRNA transcript levels (p &amp;lt; 0.05). It enhanced the antimicrobial effect, with an inhibition zone of 12.34 ± 0.75 mm for Escherichia coli, 16.41 ± 1.01 mm for Staphylococcus aureus, and 18.74 ± 1.13 mm for Candida albicans.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The CE possesses various biological activities, and the developed CE/CsNPs could serve as an appealing formulation to be further investigated for use in anticancer regimens.
          
          
            Graphical Abstract
            Synthesis of eco-friendly chitosan nanoparticles loaded with ethanolic extract of C. comosum (CE/CsNPs) by using citrate as an organic cross-linker. The optimum CE/CsNPs formulation loaded with 350 mg/100 mL of the extract with the highest entrapment efficiency (EE)% is a promising anticancer candidate, displaying anticancer, antioxidant, and antimicrobial in vitro potencies.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a prevalent musculoskeletal problem associated with impaired cervical functions, faulty breathing patterns, and declined respiratory functions. Diaphragm is a critical respiratory muscle and also connects to cervical spine through different fascial connections. However, the effects of diaphragm manual release (DMR) on CNP remain unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of DMR intervention on pain, disability, and diaphragm function in people with CNP.
          
          
            Methods
            A total of 33 participants with CNP were randomized into the DMR and sham release group (SG), and received the allocated intervention twice a week for 2 weeks. The DMR group received a firm pressure release technique at the 7th to 10th subcostal region along with deep breathing, while the SG group received the same technique with light touch instead. Primary outcomes including pain, disability, and diaphragm function, and secondary outcomes including neck range of motions, strength, and chest expansion were performed before and after the intervention for all participants.
          
          
            Results
            After receiving 4 sessions of intervention, the DMR group demonstrated clinically significant improvements in pain and cervical range of motion, along with potential clinically improvements in diaphragm mobility. In the SG group, only pain showed a clinical significant improvement. Cervical strength and chest expansions showed potential clinical improvements in both groups.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The current results provide preliminary evidence that the DMR shows promise as an intervention for improving pain, cervical range of motion, and potentially diaphragm mobility, cervical strength, and chest expansion in patients with CNP. However, its effects may not be clearly superior to sham intervention after 4 sessions. Future studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are required to confirm its efficacy and establish its role in CNP management.
          
          
            Trial registration
            The study was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT04664842) on 11/12/2020.
