Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            
              Calligonum comosum L’Hér. is a large perennial shrub that grows in the desert. This plant inhabits much of the Egyptian desert, but has not yet been scientifically validated. Herein, we demonstrate the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties of the ethanolic extract of the Egyptian C. comosum (CE) and its novel eco-friendly chitosan nano-formula (CE/CsNPs), which is prepared using citrate as a crosslinker.
          
          
            Methods
            The produced plant ethanolic extract (CE) was chemically analyzed. The eco-friendly CE/CsNPs were successfully developed through the conjugation of CE with different concentrations (200, 350, and 400 mg/100 mL) within the chitosan nanoparticle; then, it was fully characterized for the determination of the optimum formula and followed by the assessment of the antioxidant effects, proinflammatory cytokines, evaluation of cytotoxicity against different types of cancer cell lines, and estimation of antimicrobial effects of CE and CE/CsNPs.
          
          
            Results
            The eco-friendly CE/CsNPs-2 encapsulating 350 mg of CE was selected for the in vitro studies, as it displayed NPs with a small size and a surface charge of 37.7 ± 1.91 mV with the best encapsulation efficiency (70.15 ± 1.58%) within the CsNPs, and it showed a good release profile. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images confirmed the discrete spherical shape of CE/CsNPs-2, with no aggregations, and revealed a size range of 49.69 to 71.93 nm. FTIR displayed the successful incorporation of CE into the eco-friendly CsNPs. Regarding their biological activity, CE/CsNPs have superior efficacy with high cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines and antioxidant effects. RT-qPCR gene expression assessments displayed that CE/CsNPs resulted in a remarkable downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines’ mRNA transcript levels (p &amp;lt; 0.05). It enhanced the antimicrobial effect, with an inhibition zone of 12.34 ± 0.75 mm for Escherichia coli, 16.41 ± 1.01 mm for Staphylococcus aureus, and 18.74 ± 1.13 mm for Candida albicans.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The CE possesses various biological activities, and the developed CE/CsNPs could serve as an appealing formulation to be further investigated for use in anticancer regimens.
          
          
            Graphical Abstract
            Synthesis of eco-friendly chitosan nanoparticles loaded with ethanolic extract of C. comosum (CE/CsNPs) by using citrate as an organic cross-linker. The optimum CE/CsNPs formulation loaded with 350 mg/100 mL of the extract with the highest entrapment efficiency (EE)% is a promising anticancer candidate, displaying anticancer, antioxidant, and antimicrobial in vitro potencies.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Although Tai Chi has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating pain and improving functional mobility in people with chronic pain, the mechanisms underlying its pain-relieving effects remain poorly understood. We assessed the efficacy of a Tai Chi intervention on pain-related sensory, emotional, and cognitive indices in Japanese community-dwelling older adults with chronic pain.
          
          
            Methods
            A non-randomized controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks in the community of Itoshima City, Fukuoka, Japan. Adults aged ≥ 60 years with chronic pain were recruited and allocated to an intervention group or a control group. A total of 84 participants were allocated, with 44 in the intervention group and 40 in the control group. Chronic pain was defined as musculoskeletal pain lasting ≥ 3 months. Baseline characteristics of participants included age, sex, education, body mass index, comorbidities, current tobacco consumption, current alcohol consumption, and fall history. The control group received resistance training; the intervention group received resistance training and Tai Chi exercise. The main outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention: a pain numeric rating scale (NRS), the pressure pain threshold (PPT), the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI). As secondary outcomes, TSK and PCS subscales were evaluated with the same procedures. The statistical analyses used the t-test, χ2-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and analysis of covariance with adjustment for baseline characteristics.
          
          
            Results
            No baseline characteristics differed significantly between the groups. At 12 weeks, the intervention group showed significant improvements in the NRS (p = 0.02, 95%CI: −2.20, − 0.18), PPT (p = 0.003, 95%CI: 0.22, 0.99), TSK (p = 0.004, 95%CI: −6.35, − 1.22), and PCS (p = 0.01, 95%CI: −10.18, − 1.43) versus the control group. There was no significant between-group difference in the CSI values. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, significant interactions were revealed between time and group for PPT (p = 0.02), TSK (p = 0.02), and PCS (p = 0.03) as well as the subscales TSK-Somatic Focus (p = 0.02) and PCS-Rumination (p = 0.01).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Tai Chi intervention may serve as a potential treatment for chronic pain by addressing sensory, emotional, and cognitive aspects of pain.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a prevalent musculoskeletal problem associated with impaired cervical functions, faulty breathing patterns, and declined respiratory functions. Diaphragm is a critical respiratory muscle and also connects to cervical spine through different fascial connections. However, the effects of diaphragm manual release (DMR) on CNP remain unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of DMR intervention on pain, disability, and diaphragm function in people with CNP.
          
          
            Methods
            A total of 33 participants with CNP were randomized into the DMR and sham release group (SG), and received the allocated intervention twice a week for 2 weeks. The DMR group received a firm pressure release technique at the 7th to 10th subcostal region along with deep breathing, while the SG group received the same technique with light touch instead. Primary outcomes including pain, disability, and diaphragm function, and secondary outcomes including neck range of motions, strength, and chest expansion were performed before and after the intervention for all participants.
          
          
            Results
            After receiving 4 sessions of intervention, the DMR group demonstrated clinically significant improvements in pain and cervical range of motion, along with potential clinically improvements in diaphragm mobility. In the SG group, only pain showed a clinical significant improvement. Cervical strength and chest expansions showed potential clinical improvements in both groups.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The current results provide preliminary evidence that the DMR shows promise as an intervention for improving pain, cervical range of motion, and potentially diaphragm mobility, cervical strength, and chest expansion in patients with CNP. However, its effects may not be clearly superior to sham intervention after 4 sessions. Future studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are required to confirm its efficacy and establish its role in CNP management.
          
          
            Trial registration
            The study was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT04664842) on 11/12/2020.
