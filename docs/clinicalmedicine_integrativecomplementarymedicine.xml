Abstract: 
                    
                    
                      This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the impact of preoperative progressive relaxation exercises on postoperative pain, comfort, and quality of recovery. The study was conducted between June and November 2023, involving 68 patients undergoing surgical intervention and hospitalized in the surgical clinic. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)-Pain, the Perianesthesia Comfort Scale, and the Quality of Recovery Questionnaire. At the sixth postoperative hour, no significant difference was observed in pain levels between the experimental and control groups (
                      P
                      &amp;gt; .05). However, the VAS scores for the experimental group at the 12th and 24th postoperative hours were significantly lower than those of the control group (
                      P
                      &amp;lt; .001). Furthermore, 24 hours postoperatively, the experimental group demonstrated significantly higher quality of recovery (
                      P
                      &amp;lt; .001) and comfort levels (
                      P
                      &amp;lt; .001) than the control group. This study concludes that patients engaged in relaxation exercises exhibited lower VAS scores and higher levels of recovery and comfort.

Abstract: Abstract
          
            Background
            Changji’an Formula (CJAF) is an effective Chinese herbal prescription to treat irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), which is derived from two famous classical prescription: Sijunzi decoction and Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang. However, the molecular mechanism has not been well defined. This study aims to illustrate the molecular mechanism of CJAF in the treatment of IBS-D.
          
          
            Methods
            Chemical components of CJAF were determined by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) and further verified by reference standards. IBS-D model was induced in C57BL/6J mice by a single edema with colonic infusion of 0.1 mL trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS, 50 mg/mL) combined with 7 days of restraint stress, 2 h/d. The treatment group was given rifaximin (100 mg/kg) and high, moderate and low doses of CJAF by gavage for 7 days, respectively (n = 7). After administration, the main symptoms of IBS-D were tested, and behavioral tests were conducted using sucrose preference test and open field test. The colonic tissues of mice were obtained. Gene and protein expression of mast cell tryptase, nerve growth factor (NGF), tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA), phosphorylated TrkA, growth associated protein 43(GAP43) and neuro-specific enolase (NSE) were determined by RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
          
          
            Results
            36 compounds were identified by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, and the determined components can be categorized into 7 chemical types, including 16 flavonoids, 7 triterpenoids, 4 alkaloids, 3 sesquiterpenoids, 2 monoterpene glycosides, 2 organic acids, 1 phenylpropanoids and 1 tannin. Animal experiment showed that the abdominal pain and diarrhea symptoms of IBS-D mice were alleviated by CJAF. The sucrose preference, total translocation distance and average velocity of movement in the open field test was upregulated. The mRNA and protein expression of mast cell marker tryptase, as well as NGF, phosphorylated TrkA, GAP43 and NSE in IBS-D mice colonic tissues were down-regulated by CJAF.
          
          
            Conclusions
            CJAF could effectively alleviate abdominal pain and diarrhea symptoms of IBS-D by inhibiting the activation of colonic mast cells and the resultant activation of NGF/TrkA signal pathway. Therefore, CJAF affords a potential candidate for the treatment of IBS-D.
